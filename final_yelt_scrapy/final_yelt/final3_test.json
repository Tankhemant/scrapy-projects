        "reviewer_comment": "I had a nice experience here.<br><br>I ordered a three-topping slice of pizza: ham, pineapple, and spinach(don&#39;t ask why about the spinach lol). It came out to just under 10$ including a tip. I was pleasantly surprised by the thickness of the bread/crust. It was puffy and wonderful. The wait wasn&#39;t bad at all, but I was the only person in queue at the time. And the man that eventually handed me my pizza was particularly kind.<br><br>The ordering system was a bit unclear at first, because the kiosks were spread apart on the front counter and there were employees hovering nearby(I wondered if they were going to take my order), but I figured out relatively quickly that I was expected to tap away on the screen.<br><br>It&#39;s pizza at the mall!! It&#39;s not that deep! There are many seats to choose from, and there are a lot of people passing though, so the environment is on the noisier side. There are many other food options nearby in the food court, but if you&#39;re feeling pizza, might as well stop here !!",

        "reviewer_comment": "While a college student at U.C. Berkeley decades ago, I lived on slices of Blondie&#39;s Pizza on Telegraph Avenue.  While visiting San Francisco, I was excited that there was a Blondie&#39;s in the basement food court of the Westfield San Francisco Centre.  I ordered a pepperoni slice, a California slice, and a soda.  The California slice has pepperoni, green peppers, and mushrooms.  While the pizza slices looked good, the taste was just better than okay.  Now I have the urge to go back to Berkeley to see if the Blondie&#39;s Pizza on Telegraph Ave is as good as I remember as a college student.  While I am likely to give Blondie&#39;s in SF a 2nd chance, I wasn&#39;t impressed the first time.",

        "reviewer_comment": "I missed Blondies of Berkeley, Powell, and concord..but it will remain in the past.  The slices are big and the bread is decent, but the taste just isn&#39;t there.  Tasted like cardboard and flavorless.  <br><br>Staff is also unfriendly.  This kiosk and forgetting half the order is frustrating for staff and customer.  They&#39;ll mess up the extra $0.99 ranch and drink add ons, and act irritable when you ask for them. I went at opening,  how can you be that irritable already?!  The same man, if my eyes served me correctly, used no gloves, and parted the stringed cheese from pizza, with his bare hands.  <br><br>I can&#39;t ask for much for $6 pizza.  If you&#39;re hungry, you&#39;re hungry.  The best thing about the location is knowing there&#39;s other places worth trying in the food court.",

        "reviewer_comment": "Talk about nostalgia! I grew up eating at the Powell location next to Rasputin Music. My mom would take my sister and I there when we were little and we would each order a fat slice on a plate. There was no seating upstairs (there was downstairs) and everyone would stand around the counters against the wall and devour the thick, hot, cheesy, gooey pizza! It was all goodness! In high school, I would come here for a slice with friends and we would all hang out downstairs for hours talking, laughing, listening to music. I would hit up Rasputin next door to look for music. Those were the good old days. The epitome of my youth!<br><br>When I heard Blondie&#39;s was reopening in the Westfield center&#39;s food court, I HAD to come check it out! There it was - different that it&#39;s predecessor which was a 2 story, fast paced pizza joint. It is now a small version, a walk up counter next to a hot dog place. But, the pizza smells the same and taste the same. It is still the thick slice! The soft pillowy crust and the stringy hot cheese topped with pepperoni. It made me want to cry to taste this again. Blondie&#39;s is still my favorite pizza place and will always hold a special place in my heart. I am happy you are back.",

Well it looks like they&#39;re back but in a new location a few blocks from their original spot and now living on the lower level of the Westfield San Francisco Centre (in the food court). Same great pizza and taste that I never realized how much I missed. <br><br>Stopped by this new Blondie&#39;s location for the first time a few weeks ago with my husband. We were immediately greeted by their friendly staff and our order was quickly filled with the freshest slices they had available on the display. Prices were reasonable and justified that signature Blondie&#39;s Pizza taste. My husband and I each ordered a Pepperoni Special ( a slice of pepperoni with a drink) and an additional California slice which was their special of the day. The California slice had pepperoni, mushroom, and green pepper as toppings. All slices were a good size, tasted as if they were prepared and served fresh, and had quality toppings. A solid pizza choice while in the area or shopping at Westfield. <br><br>Super excited to have Blondie&#39;s Pizza back in the area. Though it was my first time visiting this spot, it&#39;s definitely not my last. Looking forward to trying more of their combinations in the future.",

The staff runs around like chickens with their heads chopped off as tickets come in. The thing is is they only offer 3 different pizzas. It should be very easy to get the order heat the pizza and give it to the customer. A 3 minute wait. People who placed their orders with the cashier received that experience. Those who ordered through the kiosk waited 20 minutes. The staff had no process in place. They had no clue which tickets needed to be served and which had gone out. They began just asking people what they ordered. Which is bad business, because then people will begin saying they ordered 2 slices, a water, a soda, etc. <br><br>Also they are not following health code standards. The people pouring the sodas were using the cup to put the ice in instead of an ice shovel and they are also not cleaning their soda machine, because the Coke I ordered tasted like a combination of Coke and Dr. Pepper.

I remember being shorter and smaller, sticking close to my mom, surrounded by strangers all standing, focused on their pizza. Then I remember revisiting as a young adult, often lounging downstairs with a slice or two (usually two, special of the day and a pepperoni!). <br><br>The character is obviously different. Tie dye shirts have been traded for a sleek neon sign. It&#39;s normal, natural for change. What matters most is the food, and sadly, it didn&#39;t seem as good for me. <br><br>Sometimes the special of the day is a preference issue, but I felt like it just didn&#39;t have that flavor I loved in both the 2000s and the 2010s. Even right now, I&#39;m giving 3 stars and not lower because I feel like I had to be mistaken. Maybe another day&#39;s special would be better, maybe I just needed to try a pepperoni slice.<br><br>Was it user error? I don&#39;t know, but my heart did hurt as I walked by the old storefront, nothing more than a dark, empty building.

Still tastes the same and the crust is soft and pillowy. So glad they were reopened although in the Westfield mall. They&#39;ve got a bunch of other items on the menu that I do not recall ever seeing before. Unless I just really never paid attention because I was a child and all u cared for was the pizza!!! Can&#39;t wait to try the other items. Their staff is always friendly which is always a plus.",

The key is for them to bring out a fresh pizza and just get slices right then and there. Not to found on the re heating it doesn&#39;t taste the same.  I&#39;m so happy that blondies came back!<br><br>Servers are newbies but these days good help is hard to find<br><br>I came here two days in a row first day I opted for a small pepperoni pizza because it was just 3 bucks more and I could share small slices with friends. Second day I just got a cheese and pep slice just as good .  Even the crust was soft and chewy not burnt like these new style pizzas.  Totally recommend blondies. I&#39;ll be back only thing I wish was they had more sauce on the crust just so that there&#39;s some more flavor but , anyways even the crust plain is so good ..",

You have to do everything through the online app at the counter. One of the joys of the original Blondie&#39;s was interacting with an employee. Not only that, but it&#39;s much more expensive. And the food is rather bland tasting. Ah well. Live and learn. The new owners are banking on the nostalgia and good vibes that the original Blondie&#39;s had, but are not to be found here. There&#39;s lots of choices for food here. If I have to pay high prices, I&#39;ll find a place that&#39;s actually worth it.",

After waiting patiently, they, unfortunately, gave me the wrong item, a cheese pizza slice. Anyways, no big deal... we&#39;re human, mistakes happen. The employee apologized and mentioned the cheesy bread would be ready in 4 minutes, I ended up waiting a bit over 10 minutes. On the bright side, they corrected their mistake and gave me the cheesy bread. However, it was a bit bland and the marinara dipping sauce was extremely cold (almost as if they took it out of the fridge last minute). Bit of an underwhelming experience.",

If you remember growing up and strolling outside Powell St. when you were younger, well now they&#39;re back inside Westfield Shopping Center! Check them out and it tastes just as good as you remember it!",

        "reviewer_comment": "This place made me mad. I dropped by to grab some breadsticks and sat there for 15 minutes while the employees sat around and talked. It was kinda cool that they cooked the breadsticks right there but super inconvenient because I was trying to grab something quick. Finally my $9 breadsticks come out of the oven and they have absolutely no flavor, they&#39;re literally dough sticks. The marinara is straight out of the fridge, not heated at all, and is just spaghetti sauce. Do not go here.",

There pepperoni is the best in the world, bar none. The pizza is thick and cooked to perfection. Delicious, filling, and CHEAP! I recommend this place to everyone because they are the most delicious pizza I&#39;ve ever had.",

I was so happy I felt like jumping up and down.  The server was really helpful.  I ordered a 12 inch pizza.  The wait was good, not too long.  <br>     I walked to my car.  I was so excited.  Blondie&#39;s Pizza where have you been? I missed you from my telemarketing days.  Almost every weekend I would be there. <br>      Perfect crust, slightly sweet sauce, crispy pepperoni, and an phenomenal cheese.  Put them all together and you get a pizza to die for.  I don&#39;t even like pizza but if I can only eat one food for the rest of my life it would be the pepperoni pizza from Blondie&#39;s.  <br>I hope this Blondie&#39;s Pizza stays open for a long time.  I live pretty far away but I will make trips just to eat this pizza.  Looking forward to eating more pizza from Blondie&#39;s.  To everyone reading this try this pizza! To die for doesn&#39;t even begin to describe how good it tastes! <br><br>La migliore pizza!",

Such a quick and short line and great service, no wait and hassle-free. The slice of pizza was pretty huge, the sauce was decent not super salty. I came back at the end of my day to grab a small pizza for my way home",

I have four people to share those pizza. Only 2 slices per person.  Pizza taste not bad at all because we don&#39;t like salty pizza. Need improving their services with customer&#39;s. They need organizers their food preparation. Messy in the food preparation table.",

        "reviewer_comment": "Anyone who grew up in sf knows this pizza brand has alot of memories for us locals. I used to go here all the time as a kid when it was on powell street. I used to remember how they had all the condiment shakers chained up against the tables. Honestly i wished they didnt open inside the mall because its such a small and tiny space. There is only one oven and that can make orders very slow. The old location they had a bunch of pizza ovens going at once. To me it makes zero sense to open inside the mall cause rent itself is the biggest killer. Im sure if they opened near the old location they would save a ton more money. Anyways the pizza does still pack the same taste it used to. Im glad they are back",
