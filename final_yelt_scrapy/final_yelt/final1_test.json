Great place on Divisadero to stop by before and/or after an outing at Alamo Square Park. Wasn&#39;t busy so we got sat down immediately at the table that faces the front window (great table, by the way). <br><br>Haven&#39;t really tried my hand at any Deep Dish pizzas while living here in SF and I am sooo glad Little Star was my first introduction. Just fantastic. A 6-piece pie is more than enough to share for two. Our server also mentioned that they can split it half and half with two different styles, which is what we did. The garlic bread with marinara is also some of the BEST I&#39;ve tried. <br><br>Great friendly service and atmosphere, and most importantly, great pizza. Can&#39;t wait to be back to try out all their other pies they have to offer. Hats off to you, Little Star.", "reviewer_name": "Kyle L.", "page": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/little-star-pizza-divisadero-san-francisco-2?osq=pizza"},

We were stuffed and had left overs. <br><br>I loved the deep dish! I&#39;m from New York and I would favor a classic nyc slice but no this place has turned me on to deep dish. The flavor of the sauce, the crispy dough, it was all so good. And the thin crust pizza we got was packed with vegetable toppings. All the cheese too was super gooey and delicious. The brownie with the mint gelato was amazing. Brownie was warm, rich and decadent. I wish I new the brand of gelato because that was some of the best I ever had. So creamy and chocolate chunks tasted super high quality. <br><br>The vibe is mellow, kind of chic and minimalist inside.

It&#39;s not easy to find parking in the neighborhood since it has a good number of other restaurants and businesses. But there is a parking garage near by less than 2 blocks called Alamo Square Park &amp; Charge. This garage is Mon-Fri 9am-9pm and always free, yes I couldn&#39;t believe it either. It&#39;s neat because a machine takes your car and stores it after you park your car just right on the ramp, it has to be perfectly centered. There was no wait to be seated in the restaurant and luckily I came right when happy hr was still going. <br><br>From the happy hr menu I ordered the burrata caprese appetizer and omg was it so good. The small breads or crostinis were toasted just right and the basalm was good with the burrata cheese. You could taste how fresh all the ingredients were even the olive oil. Then I ordered a personal deep dish half margherita and half build your own with bacon, pesto, goat cheese, and sundried tomatoes. Their crust is so good like a cornmeal buttery flavor? The pizza was so flavorful, both sides were great. Their deep dish is filling and rich so I had leftovers. For 2 people I&#39;d say maybe the small pizza I ordered is fine if you&#39;re sharing an appetizer. But if you&#39;re doing only pizza for 2 or more people I&#39;d say go with the bigger size pizza.

Damn Fine was on the list and since we were in the area close to dinner time, we decided to get take out pizza from them. Ordered the pizzas in the restaurant and there was about 15-20 minute wait. While I was waiting, I noticed many people were rushing outside the restaurant. The lady behind the bar told me to go out as there is a Mister Softee that stopped in front and they encouraged you to get the soft serve and eat it in the restaurant!! So I had to go out in the freezing air and order one. It made the wait for pizza feel so much shorter!! Got to try my first Mister Softee ice cream sundae as well!!<br><br>Back to the pizza!! We got two 14&#34; pizzas to go. Got home and dived in. We had the burrata and the special one with asparagus and the most colorful edible flowers.

Parking is tough but the N-Judah runs right by. No lines queuing to get in at around 2PM!

And while you&#39;re doing this it&#39;s all intermingling with the payment line. A lot of juggling and moving around. Very small area to negotiate all this. Cashier was nice and payment was fast once you got there.  A few seats outside. Otherwise take your goodies home or to Golden Gate Park to eat or walk/eat on your way to the De Young Museum or California Science Academy. <br><br>My favorite of all was the Vegan tomato, spinach, mushroom focaccia! Biting into this, the smell and bite took me back to the tomato &amp; scallion focaccia from Liguria Bakery in North Beach. Total Yuuummm! Their version is airy and loftier and very good. Five stars for the focaccia. <br><br>I was not enamored of the rustic English Muffin, plain croissant or classic round sourdough. The English muffin was okay though it tasted like it could have baked a tad longer but definitely nothing special. The plain croissant while it had nice crispy flaky layers biting in and that butter taste. Maybe not enough butter and not as airy as a croissant should be. The classic round sourdough was crusted with sesame, poppy &amp; fennel seeds. Though it had a nice crust on the bottom, I could have done without the fennel seeds. Probably a good sourdough for most but not my thing. <br><br>Lots of other artisan baked goods to try - muffins, cookies, scones, breads, pizzas, focaccias even clotted cream!

There were plenty of street parking in the area and we got lucky with one right across the street. There was a short line, although it looked kinda long mostly because the store interior itself is small, but it moved very fast! It took total of 10 min for us to get in and out. There were no line by the time we finished eating one of the buns. Perhaps we just got really lucky with the parking + short line on the weekend. <br><br>This is a &#34;grab the baked goods yourself&#34; kind of place. They have paper bags in various sizes, which I thought was a very nice touch. Don&#39;t forget to use the tissue/wax paper provided to help grab your bread (they don&#39;t have tongs here). All the items were in still in stock by the time we arrived. <br><br>So what exactly did I get here? I honestly don&#39;t remember the specific names of each. The cashier had to help me look into the bag &amp; identify my items. She did it pretty fast, but I only had 4 items (a jalapeño cheese stick ? + Some sort of easter special bun ? + jalapeño &amp; tomato focaccia? + an almond croissant) in one bag + 1 cookie in another bag + 1 focaccia from the counter. Total was $24 ish.<br><br>TLDR: <br>I thought the focaccia from the counter would be warm, but it&#39;s room temperature too. I really really liked it though.

The scones always have a delightfully delicate crispy exterior and a soft, light but moist crumbly interior. It just the right amount of sweetness and you can taste the richness from the butter and I love bits of fresh fruit throughout the scone. I always get the scone of the day when I&#39;m here. <br><br>-Bialy ($3): the bialy is another of my favorites here. It&#39;s topped with carmelized onion and toasted spices, making for the perfect savory and fragrant bread. It&#39;s a nice chewy sourdough I just can&#39;t get enough of. <br><br>-Single Slice Pizza ($3.50): I&#39;m not going to lie, I never pay attention to our remember what the pizza of the day is, but it&#39;s always good. I believe this one had spinach, onion and artichooke, but the pizza always comes out wrapped in foil which makes it seem deceptively warm - don&#39;t fall for the trick it&#39;s scalding hot. The pizza dough is perfectly chewy, the vegetables give you the vague excuse of health while providing great flavor and texture, a generous amount of gooey cheese creates the perfect cheese pull and savory slice to enjoy sitting at the benches outside of the bakery.

The first bite I took, I thought it was just alright. Very corny. Crisp. Lovely exterior texture. Almost like those big fat bakery cookies that are crisp on the outside with a burnt buttery crust at the bottom. <br><br>Even though I tried to stop, I found myself not being able to. Someone send help. Finished this big scone in one go. <br><br>The inside is very reminiscent of cornbread.

I think they probably have knives if you want to spread it yourself but where&#39;s the fun in that?<br><br>More recently, I&#39;ve returned for dinner because I saw they do pizza as well (and smash burgers on Wednesdays!) and it was so cool seeing how different the vibes were! The space is completely transformed with a really nice bar with a good selection of interesting wines. <br><br>The smash burger was really tasty (the sauce is pretty sweet but it goes well with the charred patty) but I think the pizza is definitely more stand out. We got the truffle honey as well which I think is a must -- it was really amazing with the crispy pepperoni and cheesy caramelized crust. <br><br>The staff is also incredibly fun and friendly and overall this place is such a local gem, I can already see myself being a regular here (it&#39;s worth the trek!)", "reviewer_name": "Cynthia S.", "page": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-laundromat-san-francisco?osq=pizza"},

The interior is beautifully decorated, full of plants and records while the bar stacked with collection of wines. Would recommend a wine shot if you&#39;re curious about what to get. At $5 a shot you can taste test a sample at a relatively low cost. <br><br>The pizzas here come with that crispy edge and glorious crunch. Square pan pizza is definitely a heavier meal but the fresh toppings and honey drizzle make for a lighter flavor. Our table of 4 ordered 2 pizzas and a salad to share. <br><br>The kale salad was refreshing and a good break from all the carbs. However we would have loved to see the kale a bit more massaged and dressed. The mushroom combo pizza was the star of the night. Not often we opt for a white sauce pizza but the sauce complimented the mushrooms making for a rich flavor. We did note that the mushroom pizza did come with a heavy sprinkling of parsley so if you&#39;re not a fan magnet ask for it on the side. <br><br>Definitely opt for the honey as it adds a sweet kick to each bite! The meatball pizza came with a good amount of toppings and the fresh burrata made for a creamy bite. Each pizza comes with 6 pieces and piping hot out of the oven. Perfect for sharing and sampling different flavors. <br><br>Will be back for more crispy edges and wine!", "reviewer_name": "Chloe S.", "page": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-laundromat-san-francisco?osq=pizza"},

And way more busy than any other Italian restaurant nearby. They have like 10 different pizza styles, many award winning. I ordered their 3 most popular pizzas. Ranked from favorite <br><br>1. Classic Italian style 12&#34; - Cal Italia $30: good. Very unique combination of flavors. Sweet. Salty. Not my usual flavor combo but it worked well. Semi firm crust <br>2. Coal fired style 15-16&#34; - New Yorker $35: decent. Basically an all meat pizza. This was the crispiest/firmest of all the crusts. Wish it had some veggies <br>3. Napoletana style 12&#34; - Margherita $26: ok. What you&#39;d expect. Very thin and limp crust <br><br>Overall, their all solid. Just depends on your preference for pizza style. You can taste the quality. The new Yorker was the bigger of the 3, other 2 were basically personal size. Their all thin crust so 1 pizza is definitely doable for males <br><br>Extensive wine menu of both California and European wines. Beer list is average, limited with some crafts. <br><br>Service was ok. Not bad, not great. Took 10 mins or so after being seated before the server came and water was brought out. Food didn&#39;t take too long to come out, but depends on the pizza style you order. Some take longer than others <br><br>They have indoor and outdoor seating. No reservations but they have a yelp wait list. Wait list for a time earlier than you plan to sit. It took an extra 45 mins past my scheduled sit down time to actually get seated.

The tomato sauce, mozzarella, and dough are all insanely flavorful, with a chewy texture but in the best way.

The star of the show is their Nepalese-style pizza - we ordered the Bufilana ($19).  If you are craving Hawaiian, keep walking. For the record, I like Hawaiian pizza. We were lucky enough to get a seat right by the pizza oven where the pizzas are prepared right in front of you, adding an extra layer of entertainment to our dining experience. I must stay, the two guys preparing the pizzas were amazing. We saw only one pizza get trashed due to an extended stay in the oven the entire time we were there. <br><br>Their al dente pastas are perfectly cooked with fantastic flavor.  We ordered the Carbonara ($18) with I would totally recommend. And on the beverage front, they have an impressive selection of wines and some great beers on tap. When in Rome, order a Peroni ($6) - we did. <br><br>No big negatives other than the service is too fast. Yep, not my usual complaint but we were barely halfway done with our salad when the pizza and pasta arrived. We had to quickly drop our salad forks in order to enjoy the piping hot pizza and pasta. Also, on weekends, you may encounter a wait for a table as they don&#39;t take reservations. Once seated, be prepared for a lively atmosphere, as the restaurant tends to get a bit noisy. But that&#39;s all part of the charm - right?.<br><br>Il Casaro is a true taste of Naples in the middle of North Beach.

To our surprise, we actually left really underwhelmed! <br><br>We ordered the Imported Burrata, Beet Salad, and Il Casaro pizza. Here are my thoughts on the food:<br><br>-The Imported Burrata was probably my favorite of the 3. The burrata was rich and had a nice touch of olive oil and salt/pepper. The pizza dough that came with it was yummy. The arugula was slightly over salted but tasted fine when paired with the cheese and bread. <br><br>-The beet salad was disappointing. We felt it lacked flavor, and the beets and walnuts completely carried the salad! In fact, I felt like I had to get some of either in each bite otherwise the greens sometimes tasted bitter. There wasn&#39;t enough goat cheese in our salad for that to be a substantial flavor (sucks bc I love goat cheese!!) <br><br>-The Il Casaro Pizza was honestly just very *okay*. Again, flavor was really lacking. The pizza crust tasted good, and I felt like there was potential in the dough, but then the pizza itself was soggy. <br><br>Some other notes and things to keep in mind:<br><br>-The hosts and waiters were really friendly and brought out our food really fast! But, it took a while to get our check even though the restaurant wasn&#39;t busy because workers clearing things as if closing (they don&#39;t close till 11 and it was around 9:30). <br><br>TLDR; all our food lacked flavor but this place seems to have a great reputation based on past reviews.

This is a fairly nondescript pizza shop with a handful of tables and a small standing area. There were a lot of good-looking pies in the case, but I went with a classic pepperoni slice.

This place has quickly become my go-to spot for deep dish pizza in town, and I can&#39;t recommend it enough.<br><br>First and foremost, let&#39;s talk about the star of the show--the deep dish pizza. Wow! It was absolutely delicious. The crust was perfectly crispy on the outside and wonderfully doughy on the inside, just the way a deep dish pizza should be. The combination of cheese, sauce, and toppings was simply heavenly. Each bite was bursting with flavor, and the generous portions left me feeling fully satisfied. Square Pie Guy definitely knows how to make a remarkable deep dish pizza!<br><br>Aside from the phenomenal pizza, Square Pie Guy also offers an array of awesome sides. I tried their buffalo wings and asparagus and they were a delightful addition to the meal. Warm, buttery, and infused with just the right amount of buffalo sauce, these wings were absolute perfection. The sides here are a great complement to the main event and elevate the overall dining experience.<br><br>One aspect that sets Square Pie Guy apart is the great music they play. The ambiance of the place was enhanced by the fantastic tunes playing in the background. The music selection was diverse, with a mix of genres that catered to various tastes. It created a lively and enjoyable atmosphere that added an extra layer of enjoyment to my meal.<br><br>Moreover, the service at Square Pie Guy was outstanding. The staff was friendly, attentive, and genuinely passionate about their food. They were happy to provide recommendations and make sure my dining experience was exceptional. The attention to detail and customer satisfaction truly stood out.<br><br>Overall, Square Pie Guy exceeded my expectations on all fronts. The deep dish pizza was phenomenal, the sides were delicious, and the music added a fantastic touch to the ambiance. I left with a happy heart and a full belly, eagerly looking forward to my next visit.

The next thing we got was the NAYALITA pizza (with burrata cheese instead of gorgonzola cheese). I was very well made and exactly what I was expecting. The balsamic glaze was the perfect touch to this pizza. For pasta, we chose the PASTA TARTUFO, which was described as Seasonal truffle in a delicate parmesean truffle cream.

We got pepperoni, veggie and a ham and pineapple. Between the pepperoni and the pineapple and ham one, the pepperoni was far better but not like those of NY (cheesy, greasy, thin crust). Because they&#39;re reheated in the oven upon order, some parts were hot others were cold, my ham and pineapple one was just cold from the very first bite. For 4 slices of pizza and 2 small drinks + tip, I paid almost $40 when that&#39;s the price of ordering an entire pie from the comfort of your own home. <br><br>About 4 small tables offered for seating, one long standing bar offered too.

The you say potato is a unique option I like. Their mushroom pizza is also a go to for me. <br><br>I recommend getting slices. When we get a full pizza delivered they tend to be not as good. Often too thick of a crust, which is common here if the west coast. But when we ask for thin crust we hope it would be as thin as the slices at the shop. But not so much.

The place was relatively busy but we were able to order at the counter right away. I chose a Mushroom Slice, and my friends got the Veggie, Hawaiian, Cheese, and Pepperoni (all slices). First off, most of us are from New York so we were skeptical from the start. The service was quick and the place looked pretty authentic - with a huge NYC subway map as decor and the overall vibe of an New York dollar slice store. However, the slices were far from a dollar - $5.50 to $6.50, which I found to be wild. And then of course, the POS system prompts you to add a tip. <br><br>The slices came out pretty fast and we ate them on the spot (there were a few tables inside). I had to request red pepper flakes and parmesan because they didn&#39;t have those out, and they came in little packets - definitely not very New York. But the crust of the slices was sufficiently thin and crispy, which I appreciated. There was a bit too much flour on the bottom, but the toppings were all pretty good.

(Hey i was young and poor and so was she)<br>Pizza was burnt to a crisp! It wasn&#39;t well done, it was cremated to the point where I wondered if an ex was working the oven.  I landlined my complaint and the grouchy middle-aged manager said no dice. We ain&#39;t coming back. Bring it in if you want me to look at it.  No car and the taxi ride would have been more than the pizza.  I told him that I grab a slice there at least once a week but never again. He laughed and hung up. Never saw the date again, <br>I kept my word for over 3 decades !!!Slow-forward to last year when at a gathering in the Castro everyone wanted pizza and the Sausage Factory was closed.   <br>Let it go they all said, he&#39;s in his eighties if he&#39;s still alive.  (Not wishing anyone dead over a burnt pie but mathematically they were correct)<br>So we ordered and I insisted we pick-up the pies, no delivery.  And they were good.  We have ordered several more times and no more char pizzas.  Staff is nice, prices are good and pizza is ready when I get there.  Oh I&#39;m never doing delivery again.  No need to tempt fate!  And that is my poorly punctuated tale of a grudge erased.", "reviewer_name": "Miss F.", "page": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/marcellos-pizza-san-francisco?osq=pizza"},

I also like the seating here, if you&#39;re a larger person, you may find it cramped but if you&#39;re an smaller introvert, the seating will be perfectly private. <br><br>Now for pizza crust comparisons... I would say the crust is like a fancier Costco crust (which I think is a compliment).  The crust is similar also to Long Bridge but the toppings here are less flavorful.

The experience here is nice, and a great place to snack at night or if you&#39;re waiting in line for Balboa Cafe.<br><br>Where I take primary issue is with the price- many by-the-slice shops, including Good Life, charge a lot for a slice, and for some it can be inconvenient to the point of being unaffordable. If you&#39;re drunk and need something greasy in your system, it&#39;s a wonderful option, but I&#39;d also consider finding someone frying hot dogs on the sidewalk.", "reviewer_name": "Evan K.", "page": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-good-life-pizza-san-francisco?osq=pizza"},

Excellent appetizer that is savory, fragrant, with a nice touch of cilantro and cheese. The sauce is excellent (you may want to save some for the wings or pizza)<br><br>2) Herbed Chicken. You get drumsticks and wings. Although I am a drum-man, the wings impressed me! So tender with lots of flavor.

It sounds weird, but the corn, red onion, and cheese are such an excellent, subtly done combination.<br><br>4) NYC Style Pie. This is a nice upgrade for the pep fans out there. Lots of small, tasty pepperoni over a strong layer of cheese. Well-done classic pep pie!<br><br>Takeaways. It wont hurt your wallet, and the food is delicious.

My gf had gotten the Sachetti and I had gotten the gnocchi. Her sachetti was very creamy and the sauce was very rich. The gnocchi was cooked perfectly, though I don&#39;t think the sauce was all that. The pizza though, was really good. It was a thin and crispy crust. The cold cheese caught me off guard but I still enjoyed it. Because we sat at the bar, we got to watch the workers make the pizza and cook it in the pizza oven. It was pretty cool to watch. The food deserves a 3!<br><br>I genuinely liked Bottega a little bit better than Napizza. I think this place was Graeme&#39;s more towards the pizza than the other food.

We ended up there after walking on the beach. Our friends, another couple, recommended it. We have a routine of strolling on Ocean Beach, which is enjoyable despite the cold and the wind. We started when they had a dog, but they had to give it up because of aggressive behavior, and we now get together with only our pup. They have been sort of regulars at the sister business, a coffee shop with, they told us, the best cinnamon toast. So our quartet plus canine for five logged two and a quarter miles on a convivial Saturday afternoon. We then piled into one car to make it easier to find parking and headed to this place.<br><br>We split three pizzas. One had clams, another mushrooms, and the last sausage. We also had the fried vegetable starter, the &#34;fritto&#34; of cauliflower and green beans. Our pizzas were more on the limp of the spectrum than well done. Our friends remarked, however, that the first time they had dined at the establishment, their pies were much more crisper, on the verge of burnt. The claim here is &#34;wood fired.&#34; I have no doubt. The ingredients had to have exceeded minimum standards. They had that taste that is achieved when you are hungry. The appetizer was lightly breaded and satisfyingly fresh and flavorful. There were no complaints about anything. We also had wine, the ladies; beer, my counterpart in the other couple; and a sour beer, me. They had a good list of beverages for a pizza joint.<br><br>Although we were there only a few minutes past five, by the time we left it was full up. They are popular. I&#39;m surprised from time to time that the Outer Sunset neighborhood attracts such crowds, but that is my ignorance more than anything else. The only aspect of the evening that should be mentioned so it is not a surprise is that San Francisco is not a cheap city. This is normal by city standards.<br><br>Our friends are the sort of good friends whom I am glad to make later in life. As you age, you lose the wonderful ability that children have to meet a new acquaintance and just about immediately come to a mutual decision to be pals. In professional settings, people have mixed motives to be collegial. You have interactions that are not ideal. Yet we remain social animals, as Aristotle declared.

Pizzetta 211 is in my neighborhood and it&#39;s excellent so it is tough to acknowledge Damn Fine as better than the neighborhood fave but it is. Make a reservation because the place is very popular despite its Outer Sunset location and unless you&#39;re going early (before 6pm) you could have a long wait even on a weekday. <br><br>First time around we tried the Margherita Pizza and The Acapulco. Second time we tried Pig In The Woods and Alotta Burrata. Every one we try seems better than the previous one to be honest!! <br><br>First, the pizza dough itself is unbelievably light, super thin and flavorful and even though the pizzas are all 14 inches you will definitely want to devour an entire pizza! My kid normally leaves the crust everywhere but the Damn Fine dough is so addictive and evenly good, he doesn&#39;t leave any of it uneaten. <br>The prices at on the higher side but all the ingredients (veggies, cheeses, meats) are super fresh and high grade which makes the pizzas here that much better.  <br><br>Verdict:<br>My overall favorite is &#34;The Acapulco&#34;. I think it&#39;s the best pizza in SF. Don&#39;t be daunted by the mention of Habanero peppers in the ingredient list. The thin strings of habanero give the other ingredients (melt in your mouth prosciutto , fresh mozzarella, queso fresco, pineapple) a really nice kick.  (10/10)<br><br>A very close second is the Alotta Burrata which we ordered without the prosciutto. My new go to vegetarian pizza. (10/10)<br><br>The Margherita is the best in town in my opinion and that&#39;s a high bar for the litmus test at any place that serves pizza. But I&#39;ll give it a 9.5/10 because some of the other options at Damn Fine are even better. <br><br>Pig In The Woods is also a great meat option. Pancetta + Truffle cheese + Enoki mushrooms. And the basil and garlic addons with that combination.. wow! Definitely a 9.5/10 for me right behind the unbelievable Acapulco. <br><br>Also tried the lemonade and bartender&#39;s mock-tail choice du jour which was an awesome non alcoholic Rosé with lemonade (and I swear there was some hibiscus in there). (9/10)<br><br>The salads are solid and fine to start / share but that&#39;s not what I would make the trip to Damn Fine for. (8.5/10)<br><br>Other than that the service is great as is the ambience.

For take out, we brought it to the park and it was a grand delicious time. We ate here on a Friday night which had an incredible line at 8pm. We were #31 in line so we first went for a walk to the candy store, then we got a small table in the bar at Original Joe&#39;s and had wine while we waited. We waited a good hour and 15 minutes for a table. We were sat outside on a side table and had a great server named Rose or maybe Sara Rose. She was personable, friendly, and attentive. My son liked the necklace she made of shells and pearls and they talked about it. <br><br>We had their Chopped Salad and didn&#39;t care for it. It had sweet dressing and very large cut pieces of lettuce so it wasn&#39;t quite chopped. However, we weren&#39;t there for the salad so we&#39;ll pretend we didn&#39;t have it. I was so excited to have their gluten free Garlic Bread as a starter. It was light and just enough to get my palate ready for pizza. I then had the gluten free Detroit style Motorhead pizza and my husband had the regular dough 1000 degree coal fired New Yorker. The pizzas were fantastic. The Detroit style was thick with crunchy sides. So yummy. They don&#39;t skimp on the toppings so every bite has something. The ricotta cheese on the Motorhead was beautifully placed and when you spread some of that around, it&#39;s delish. My husband and son loved their New Yorker because the dough, cheese, and sauce were fantastic and had a great char. It was cooked perfectly. My husband liked how you can choose the oven temperature of the cook. <br><br>We ended the night with some Spumoni ice cream which was also really good.

Bark bark bark said my corgi friends. So I had to try it out.<br><br>This place is located balls deep in San Francisco and the crowd ordering from the store means that you should definitely order ahead of time. Even with a dozen staff making pizza pies nonstop, if you do a walk in order (from a touch screen at the counter, several bodies deep), it&#39;s going to take at least 30 minutes during its busiest hours. They know its going to be a wait since there&#39;s a water cooler in the corner, and even people picking up at the store are waiting up to 20 minutes! You can spend the time waiting by watching the pros work the assembly line while 10 finished orders are sitting on the shelves, yet none of them are for the actual crowd who&#39;s waiting. True to San Franciscans, don&#39;t make eye contact with anyone unless you&#39;re a cutieful corgi.<br><br>Some corgis also pull up curbside in their swanky EV SUVs but are stuck waiting as well. With this much business being slammed every afternoon, its worth the wait right?<br><br>Szechuan Chili Honey Fried Chicken Wings - 3 wings, 3 drumlets. Despite being covered in a sweet and spicy glaze that is well seasoned, mildly spicy, and very sweet, it remains crispy even after steaming in its box for about 10 minutes in the cold afternoon in San Francisco&#39;s Metrodome. At $14 its pricey as bark, but at least you know it&#39;s properly fried. The meat was juicy and you could hear the crisp texture crack when biting through.<br><br>Melissa King&#39;s &#34;The King&#39;s Pie&#34; - This is a pizza with a mushroom focus, pickled pepper, Szechuan chili honey, parsley, grana cheese. For a detroit square pizza, this is what she calls &#34;simple&#34;, but it is packed with flavor. If you like pizzas on the sweet side with a splash of heat and crispy toppings and the cheese is comparable if not better than your typical high quality grande blends. At $25, you&#39;ve got enough slices for four people and god damn eating more than one slice will mos def make you corgi levels of fat.<br><br>Personally, I am not a huge fan of sweet pizza (otherwise this would probably be a 5 star rating) and the price is high (even if it&#39;s SF), but there are plenty of other great options for corgis and pie lovers so don&#39;t let that deter you.

Yes, they didn&#39;t take reservations so yes, our party of 5 had quite the wait ahead of us since we arrived at 7:15pm but the heated lamps and being able to pull up 5 chairs into a small circle definitely helped pass the time just a little quicker. Admittedly, we almost lost faith. At about 8pm, we still hadn&#39;t been sat and almost got up to leave but the guy that took our name quickly came over and talked us into staying pointing at the table that would be ours. Alright, sold.<br><br>We began our meal with the cheeseboard which comes with 5 crostini, olives, candied walnuts, plums, and two cheeses. Ours was a funky goat cheese and a smoky hard gouda. Yum. Both were so good and no, that wasn&#39;t just the hunger talking. We also opted for a bottle of Fiano di Avellino which was deliciously fruity and not too dry.<br><br>For pizzas, different people shared different pies. I shared the fresh farm egg pizza with a friend. ABSOLUTELY DELISH. Everything played so well together from the pesto to the sundried tomatoes, pepperoni, and creamy fresh egg. The crust is thin and crispy so it may not be everyone&#39;s favorite texture, but I still enjoyed it (even though my favorite style is pan crust).<br><br>To complete our meal we had to have dessert. We split both the flourless chocolate almond cake and the daily special which was a plum(?) galette. Both again we&#39;re great. The housemade whip was definitely also a fan favorite on both. If I had to choose though, I&#39;d go for the galette again. It&#39;s play on sweet and sour was just so so GOOD.

Read a bunch of reviews and wanted to impress my girl with a great Italian pick. We couldn&#39;t sit at the bar (or anywhere) because the bartender was on his lunch break and no one in the restaurant knew how to make a drink until that was actually incorrect and there was someone. Our waiter was unprofessional, clearly not into Italian food and corrected my pronunciation of caprese salad to &#34;capreece&#34;  Help me Jesus. Then asked what kind of meat we wanted with it... which was weird but I guess this is what faux Italian joints do. <br>When the Capreece  salad finally came out, the tomatoes were mealy and not sweet... they were old/frozen whatever foul tomato place this garbage comes from, the mozzarella was unseasoned (not enough salt) and finding anyone to get salt was an unfriendly experience. The drink I ordered was.... Drinkable but too sweet for a Negroni. The fried cauliflower was off the hook good though. No one came to check on us after our meal was served. So for $64, we got a mediocre lunch with poor service.

The former is usually run by a guy named Vinnie who wears a wife-beater and talks like he&#39;s auditioning for the part of a pizza guy on &#34;The Sopranos&#34; and still couldn&#39;t get the part. I&#39;m thinking of a place like 2 Bros Pizza in NYC where you see all walks of Lower Manhattan life get two big slices and a soda for $2.75. You eat it in the back with all the other goombahs who couldn&#39;t get a date that night (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1qZh2cb&amp;s=806416d53a2bb9d1fb426822c30faeda422f1adffd0fc3da2ef84191b6e8a266\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/1qZh2cb</a>). But a Pizza Shop with capital letters must mean there&#39;s an unexpected designer element to the culinary creations coming out of the oven, right? Hmmm, not really. Jamie W. and I came here out of curiosity since a pizza spot is an unusual sight among the taquerias on 24th.<br><br>It&#39;s a modest operation with a large glass case with all their pizza pies on display, a large oven in the back and just four tables for sit-down eating. There were ten to choose from (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FQc1mHr&amp;s=5c476c7787b91988a2e5c66ea74f801ce137e67de2a3f8c0171f583e5bc3bf53\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/Qc1mHr</a>) , and at $4 a slice, I felt entitled to two. Don&#39;t judge me. So I ordered the Pepperoni and Mushroom and the White Mushroom (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1kZPcPJ&amp;s=56f4a3f8c71efd1e569405aa4eb2c9eadebbcc5eb7fb92ce0575ab37839cc63b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/1kZPcPJ</a>). Jamie must have been showing off because he ordered only one slice of the Deluxe, which featured sausage, pepperoni, mushroom, green pepper, onion and olive (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1hJQsEc&amp;s=557c264d57c3f1a7459e78aa6f2b691f43badabbd214bc0de01a346ddcb67dec\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/1hJQsEc</a>). Our verdict? It was OK. The pizza has the cracker-style crust that isn&#39;t really my preference, and the ingredients, while fresh, were rather on the bland side as if seasonings were optional. The $2 refillable sodas were helpful to wash them down. Where are my goombahs?<br><br>FOOD - 3 stars...middling on the pizza scale, not bad but honestly a bit on the Costco side when it comes to execution<br>AMBIANCE - 3 stars...could use a bit more oomph to liven up the place<br>SERVICE - 3 stars...friendly enough<br>TOTAL - 3 stars...pizza seems more directed to the hipsters than the rest of us", "reviewer_name": "Ed U.", "page": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-pizza-shop-san-francisco?osq=pizza"},

We ordered to go and got their dinner for 2 combo. For $55, it comes with your choice of 1 appetizer, 1 pasta, 1 small pizza, 1 dessert, and (if you order on a Wednesday), you also get a free red wine. I need to keep that in mind as a pick me up for hump day. A nice value for all the quality and options you get. We ordered:<br><br>Parma e Burrata Plate -- I admit, not my favorite appetizer, but it could be my bias towards prosciutto (sorry, not the biggest fan). The candied pear with the arugula and balsamic dressing was really nice and refreshing though. The prosciutto did have a nice savory counterbalance to the dish.<br><br>Pasta al Tartufo -- Who doesn&#39;t love a good parmesan pasta? And with truffles?? I love my carbs, so I definitely loved this dish. The truffle cream sauce was one of my faves. Super comforting with a nice thick consistancy. The pasta was a bit on the oilier side, so eat this while it&#39;s hot and fresh...cuz...have y&#39;all ever eaten oily pasta that&#39;s been sitting out for a sec and is lukewarm? Yea, that oil gets gross.<br><br>The Ham Pod Pizza -- Can&#39;t go wrong with a classic sausage, pepperoni and jalapeño combo. The crust and dough just melted in my mouth. I wouldn&#39;t consider this a spicy pizza, but the sausage did have a bit of heat. The small was actually quite large, and we had more than enough for left overs the next day. <br><br>Sicilian Cannoli al Pistacchio -- I&#39;m not a huge sweets girl, but the cannolis were a nice way to end our meal. There was quite a bit of cream, but it didn&#39;t feel too heavy. The skin was also a bit on the softer side, but not hating it.<br><br>Pink Onion, I&#39;ll be back, and I&#39;ll work my way through your extensive (pizza) menu.

Delicious perfectly cooked pasta in a cream sauce with an exquisite freshly shaved truffle on top. Mmmm! An absolute dream for any foodie. They are quite generous with the truffle too so in my opinion a fantastic value given how pricey truffles can be. <br><br>Last time I also had a burrata caprese. This is one of those dishes that reminds you that good food doesn&#39;t have to be complex.

I found some real gems and MPE is one of them.<br><br>Came on Friday at 6:15 with a party of 4 and they gave us a table as long as we would be done by the 740 reservation. The space is really cool and the old ovens really do impress. The servers largely had Italian accents and the tables/chairs were old and colorful. Definitely felt like I was dining in Europe!<br><br>We ordered a salad with beets and goat cheese to start and shared 3 pinsa. The salad was actually a generous portion and the 3 pinsa were more than enough for our group of 4. We got a margherita, the maranella (spicy sausage and broccolini), and one with prosciutto and pesto/pine nuts. I liked all 3 but the maranella was my fave. <br><br>We also ordered some drinks to start. I highly recommend their Rosé (the Tempranillo blend). They seemed to have a good wine list--comprehensive but not overwhelming. <br><br>Pinsa came out very fast. It&#39;s definitely lighter than regular pizza but the claims of it being &#34;low in calories&#34; is BS. It&#39;s covered in cheese and meats after all. Just enjoy your food and worry about your diet at another restaurant ;) The char on the crust here is unreal and the pinsa come whole--pizza cutters are given to cut to your liking. <br><br>Everything we ate was simple and delicious. Refreshing to have a pizza place I know is good and is centrally located. Adding this to our dinner and date night rotation! <br><br>*Notes on the location.*<br>MPE is in an alley on Stevenson/6th. If that makes you nervous, don&#39;t come. If you are worried about &#34;sketchy&#34; or &#34;seedy&#34; neighborhoods, stay in a part of the city more to your liking/sensibilities and leave the pinsa for the rest of us.

The choices of toppings for the pinsas were a bit underwhelming and while we got one that was supposed to Mozzarella, Porcini Mushroom, Artisanal Lardo (cured pork fat back), and Parsley, all we saw on our pizza were mozzarella cheese and little brown chewy &amp; gooey things (which seemed to be mushroom-like), so that was a little disappointing.<br><br>We also ordered the Tagliere Misto which came with 3 decent-sized chunks of cheese and 3 servings of meats, with some honey, jam, and toasted almonds and everything on that plate was awesome! In fact, we ended up adding some of the cheese and meats from that plate onto our pinsa!!<br><br>The wine menu was pretty impressive and they had a nice selection of wines by the glass. The dessert menu wasn&#39;t too exciting so we skipped that.<br><br>The space inside is crowded with random old-timey items and unnecessary counters and cabinets and there aren&#39;t many tables and not much room to move in there.

We had to wait about 15 minutes for a table on a Thursday at 6pm, which wasn&#39;t too bad and they texted us when our table was ready, but we still had to wait about 5 more minutes after they texted us.

Up popped this joint on Yelp and I am so glad this came up under pizza or I never would have found this Roman nirvana. It&#39;s a really cool looking joint and for being a small place, the seating with the bars and long tables is conducive to getting a lot of people in at once which was a huge plus. We were seated at the bar and I had a lot of time to observe the decor. Everything is curated very tastefully and it&#39;s really fun to look around the room. <br><br>I&#39;ve never had a pinsa before this experience and I would say I would never go back to pizza but alas, there aren&#39;t any pinserias near me in South Bay. I shared a Casal Bertone, the stars being guanciale and honey, as well as a Trullo that featured a lamb sausage. I heard that the Trullo was one of the favorites on the menu and it was very tasty. For me, the Casal Bertone way overshadowed it because it was so incredible. I&#39;ve always been a sucker for honey on white pizzas but this took it to the next level. The combo with the salty and crispy guanciale was a dream. Also the big difference between a pinsa and a pizza is the way the crust is made. I don&#39;t not like crust but I will tend to leave it if there&#39;s more &#34;main&#34; to finish. I did not leave any of the crust this time. It was that good. <br><br>With the incredible entree pinsa experience, I jumped at the chance to get a dessert pinsa. The pinsa was filled with a smooth, creamy *pistachio nutella* and dusted with sugar. The filling was absolutely divine.

We ordered the Mediterranean Chicken which had chicken breast, artichoke hearts, red bells, green olives, onions, and feta cheese. A stray away from the typical meat lovers Chicago style pizza, but still a deep dish and just as savory.

It&#39;s not like going to Italy. It&#39;s not a trendy, gourmet or avant garde hotspot. It&#39;s just Italian American home cooking.  It comes to your table with good, polite, conscientious service.  But what really kicks this from 3 to 4 stars is that Pasquale&#39;s food is pleasantly affordable.<br><br>After having gone here inconsistently for years, last night my family ordered cheese ravioli with marinara, baked ziti and 3 personal pizzas for the kids. We also started out with some pesto garlic bread. All of the above was just good, solid food. The kids devoured the pizzas. My ravioli was plentiful and filling. Really, nothing remarkable, but absolutely nothing bad to say.  I was only able to finish half, and as I type this I am eating the left overs for breakfast. The ziti is advertised as &#34;East Coast&#34;, which is funny because my wife was asking if I knew much about baked ziti and I explained that it&#39;s difficult to find a good rendition of the dish out West after having grown up on the stuff in NYC. Even so, I thought the ziti was good. It was cooked perfectly, and I really like their ricotta. My only complaint was that the dish was perhaps a bit watery, maybe from the marinara? The only drink of consequence was a glass of cheap chianti. The restaurant was a bit warm, and so was the wine.<br><br>When we were done eating, my wife and I wondered why we don&#39;t come to Pasquale&#39;s regularly as we have lived just a few blocks away for years.  We love Italian food and it&#39;s not as though every Italian dinner on a night out with the family has to be SPQR or Delfina.<br><br>We will definitely make this a more regular go-to spot for our family neighborhood walks.", "reviewer_name": "Jason G.", "page": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasquales-pizza-san-francisco-2?osq=pizza"},

Knowing that this the appellation in the Langhe region of Piedmont, it&#39;s also a style of wine such as a Bordeaux or and red Burgundy. To be clear, the Nebiollo grape is famously made in Barolo and in Barbaresco, Barbaresco being the lighter style of the 2 powerful, high tannin wines from Piedmont.

Anyway, I&#39;m getting real agitated at how rude this man is, while I&#39;m eyeing these bags that are clearly ready to be dispersed, just sitting there inside.<br><br>I get a text saying my order is ready (7 mins later than indicated). I flag the guy down and he BARELY glances at my phone and says &#34;Not yet ready.&#34; I tell him that the text says it is ready and he says that sometimes it is wrong. My husband and I obviously lose our cool and demand that he at least CHECK (because he was saying all this without knowing the name of the order nor checking that shelf with all those READY pickup orders). He snarkily tells us that he&#39;s sure it isn&#39;t ready yet but sure, he will go check. Well what do you know, it WAS ready, and I had been staring at that same bag for at least the last five minutes. Absolutely ridiculous.<br><br>Pizza was lackluster, super overpriced ($53 for two pizzas roughly 10&#34;x8&#34;) and expect to pay an extra 5% surcharge for the SF Mandate. Not sure why they won&#39;t open up their dining room for regular folks who want to just walk in and eat. I mean, at the very least, open up the dining room for people to stand and wait because standing outside in that area is neither enjoyable nor safe. I think it&#39;s pure laziness for businesses to continue with this lame takeout model especially when they have a fully functional dining room. But it doesn&#39;t matter, people who can afford it are gonna keep supporting this overhyped business through delivery apps nonetheless.<br><br>If you read this far, go support local hole-in-the-walls who make you feel like a valued customer and will serve you bomb food.

She was correct in doing so, which I learned when we stopped by when we happened to be in North Beach not long ago. <br><br>We began with the fried artichokes, which I had never heard of, but my gf insisted on, as it is one of her favorites (and apparently a rarity at most restaurants, so when she sees it, she always gets it). It was delightful: delicate breading on the outside with a warm, full-bodied flavor of ricotta on the inside. <br><br>We ordered two pizzas. My metric for a pizza place is its margherita pizza, and Tony&#39;s is apparently award-winning, so we ordered that (and it arrived first). Basically, the pizza was perfect. The cheese was soft, creamy, and delicious, the sauce was a lovely accompaniment (light and slightly sweet), and the crust was a divine combination of a toasted marshmallow on the outside and a pillow on the inside. <br><br>The second pizza we ordered was the Cal Italia. This one was a little more niche and artistic. The salty spice of the prosciutto, the sour bite of the balsamic, creaminess of the cheese, and sweetness of the fig all came together well atop a (once again) perfect crust. We liked the first pizza better, but this was quite nice, too. <br><br>On a non-culinary note, I also really liked the vibe of this place. We ate on the inside (one of our first times doing so since the pandemic began). It was nicely lit (dark in parts in a mood lighting sort of way) with walls decorated with old pictures in frames, and cushy, leatherish seats.

But thanx to yelpers and some deep searching we had a really amazing lunch today. My husband and I had a &#34;date&#34; to see the Chihuly @ the DeYoung Museum (which I think the last time I was there was like when I was in 4th grade? shit eons ago) Anyhoo after visiting the museum and being inspired by all the amazing glass work we wanted something good for lunch. I had already scoped out this place on yelp yesterday and read all the reviews and it sounded quaint and the food sounded fresh and unique.<br>I liked the feel of the neighborhood, and the size of the restaurant being very intimate and cozy (though I could see it being crazy at dinner time). We arrived around 1:30 on a Thursday and it was pretty full, but were able to get a seat inside for two. They also have a few tables for outside seating, and on a nice day like yesterday was perfect(but they were taken).<br>We ordered two of the pizzas of the day a summer squash with tomatoes and ricotta cheese and another with pine nuts, rosemary and a very pungent cheese  I can&#39;t remember the name but had quite a &#34;kick&#34; with every bite. The crust was thin and crunchy and the cheese perfect and chewy!<br>Each pie is made to order and fresh, fresh, fresh!<br>Like someone said its cash only (we were prepared) and with a couple of beers and a fabulous piece of flour less chocolate cake (I don&#39;t know how they make it so light and fluffy?) it was $42. Worth every penny! <br>We brought one piece of pizza home with us.<br>The the salads of the day also looked wonderful too.<br>Parking is challenging but we found some metered parking out on Clement with an easy walk. I know we aren&#39;t &#34;locals&#34; but it made our day out in SF. I love the flavor of the city and I prefer finding those out of way &#34;gems&#34; to have a really great meal.<br>I added my two pizza&#39;s to the pics.", "reviewer_name": "Susan D.", "page": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/pizzetta-211-san-francisco?osq=pizza"},

Tucked in the middle of a side street in SF, this place is definitely worth the find. My guy and I came here after a day party full of good music, dancing and drinking. After 6 hours of dancing we were ready for some pizza in our lives. We seem to eat a lot of pizza but Pink Onion stood out to both of us. Like, If MySpace was still a thing, pink onion would be on our top 8 for sure lol. <br><br>They started us out with some fresh baked bread and a very rich, complex tasting olive oil- I swear I picked up notes of arugula in this olive oil! I loved it and didn&#39;t even need balsamic to compliment it. What really stood out to us was the creativity of the pizza topping combinations.  We ordered the Kanoute pizza because it&#39;s not every day you see pistachio on pizza and I happen to love the combo of pesto and arugula. The blend of ricotta and mozzarella also made this unique to me. The crust itself was chewy and airy, not to thin and not too thick! Just how I like my pizza. It had that wonderful charred taste to it from the wood fired oven. You can tell they make their pizza&#39;s with love here! I recommend pairing their pizza with a nice glass of pinot, to truly highlight the flavors :) This was our last meal in SF before heading back to San Diego, definitely worth every dollar spent.

They clearly don&#39;t shred the mozzarella and spread it around. They put down a few mozzarella balls and they spread out as they melt but clearly not enough to cover all the pieces.  Seriously guys, take the &#34;sophistication&#34; down a notch and just grate the cheese. I&#39;m from Wisconsin.  I order pizza so that I can eat cheese.<br><br>So one pie with too little cheese. Two pies where I couldn&#39;t eat a big percentage of the crust.

The staff are so nice and were able to sit me and my friend right away at the bar. I think this is because we went on a weekday.

We were greeted by our hostess and server, they both gave us a quick heads up that happy hour only lasted 15 more minutes. I thought that was nice of them so that we could hurry and browse the happy hour menu.<br><br>We quickly received our appetizers and drinks. As we were only 50% finished with our appetizer, my plate came out but not my husbands. Let me mention that we were sitting outside and it was a bit cold with a wind. I covered my pasta plate with my napkin, expecting my husbands food to follow. We continued to eat our appetizer and about 10-12 minutes later, my husbands pizza arrived. I&#39;m sure the same goes for everyone when I say this but I think it&#39;s normal to eat a meal together, not watching one another. <br><br>Another thing I am disappointed about it that the pasta I ordered said that the dish included summer squash. I come from a family who has worked and owned a produce wholesale company since I was born. I know my fruits and veggies! I did NOT receive summer squash on my plate but instead classic zucchini. I&#39;m sure the restaurant wouldn&#39;t think people would notice and I am sure those who ordered it didn&#39;t!

It was as wonderful then as it is now - not much has changed, and that&#39;s part of the charm.<br><br>The pizza and calzone are truly heavenly when eaten hot out of the wood burning oven (it&#39;s still good, but not the same when taken To Go). I recommend sticking with only a few simple toppings on the pizza to really let the tasty crust and cheesy goodness shine through. Our other family favorites include the marinated broccoli, asparagus, and garbanzo bean antipasti, the calamari, and of course, the garlic bread. We usually stick to the pizza and calzone since they border on the divine, but all the pasta dishes I have had have been good as well. <br><br>This is truly a North Beach institution and the perfect place to bring people from out of town who want to check out the North Beach/ Barbary Coast vibe. You can stand outside while you wait for a table and enjoy the hip-shakin&#39; neon goddess as she gyrates outside the Lusty Lady across the street or watch thick-necked bouncers herd horny business men into the Hustler club. Inside you&#39;ll get excellent food and great wine (ask Dario to help you pick out a good bottle) in an old school Italian atmosphere.

Soft and fluffy with slightly crispy edges, not too saucy and square...just the way I love my pizza! The price isn&#39;t too bad either for a whole pizza with two toppings. It was under $30 and fed a family of 4 with a couple slices leftover for tomorrow. <br><br>They&#39;re definitely a favorite in our family and definitely worth the trek and lack of parking on a busy Saturday night. I recommend calling ahead and then showing up 30 mins later as they&#39;re no longer serving ready baked single slices due to pandemic.

The delivery guy was on a scooter, so all of that open rushing air cooled it down quick.  The main problem was the pizza was way over baked and the sausage tasted reheated. The crust was very dark and tough and the cheese was pretty dried out. I ordered the extra large since I like to have plenty of leftovers, but this pie was way too overdone to handle any reheating. I ate a piece and then scrapped the topping off two others, but it wasn&#39;t any better. Bottom line: $47 (pie+topping+delivery fee + sales tax +tip) completely wasted. I sent a note to the restaurant to let them know it was a bad experience, but I guess they don&#39;t care since there was no response.  I know they can make a decent pizza now and then, but I  won&#39;t gamble $47 bucks in hopes they get it right.

There&#39;s an outdoor area.&#34; And for good reason...the maximum number of people that fit in the place itself is about...15? Maybe less. it&#39;s a small space, but in my opinion (as well as our friends), it&#39;s worth it.<br><br>We usually get the cheeseboard which is pretty damn awesome, especially if you decide to eat it with wine.

So delicious that I hope they never take it off their menu!<br><br>The wait for the pizza can be a little long, especially if you&#39;re going there on a super empty stomach.

No idea what to do with my college life now, but I do know that when I get back to SF on the occasional weekend, I will be returning here sometime.<br><br>Between three people we shared three pizzettas, each ten inches in diameter and very thin, yet boasting a nice crust. The amount of ingredients was just right for the amount of dough, which was slightly toasted on the bottom yet still soft underneath the cheese and tomato sauce. The Rosemary and Pine Nuts pizzetta was my favorite; it definitely had plenty of the herb for a rich, delicious flavor and the pine nuts, which is not the usual fare for pizza, added a lovely crunchy texture, though it was not overwhelming in the least. And that cheese! It just melted in the mouth. <br><br>The Basil, Mozzarella, and Tomato pizzetta sounded simple but tasted fantastic, and the basil was sprinkled generously, complementing the cheese and sauce nicely. It was very yummy. The same pizzetta with anchovies, was not my favorite, but my fellow diners loved it. I&#39;m usually not fond of fish, and especially not on pizza, but I had a bite and it was rich with unique flavor. A nice addition, though not for me.<br><br>If I did not fit into the typical broke-college-student mold, I would love to frequent this place more often, but alas, the bill came to about fourteen dollars a person after tip.

We had the Farm Egg pizza, Bacon/Brussel Sprouts pizza, and the Margherita Pizza. The pizzas were good, but the pizzas at Arizmendi are just as good. We arrived 10 mins before they opened, and there was already a long line..on a Monday. Naturally we had high expectations. The verdict? Not worth the wait (or the money). The venue is small. The service is mediocre (they served TWO tables that arrived after us..screwed up our Farm Egg pizza and had to redo it...and oh yeah screwed up our Bacon/Brussel Sprouts pizza too.) The only mildly exceptional pizza was the Margherita. They do make a good margherita. But the service ruined it for us. They did apologize and give us a complimentary apple cobbler, BUT their sorry was not genuine, the waiter came off as completely unapologetic, and bottom line it was too little too late. <br><br>Won&#39;t be returning.

It was airy, not too tomato-y, and the crust was just browned enough. <br><br>We were in love. We talked to the waiters and to the woman behind the bar, making pizzas. She described the place as kind of a &#34;co-op,&#34; with several of the staff having small shares of ownership. <br><br>Overall, we had a great experience.

What&#39;s so great about this place is that they sell by the slice and they make interesting/unusual pizza. If that&#39;s not your thing, they also make plenty of regular type pizzas ex. pepperoni. If you dine in, the service is fast and the cooks/workers are very polite. My only complaint is that they don&#39;t take card. Who doesn&#39;t take cards??? Their pizza style is a thin new york type pizza crust. My first visit there I had this weird salami, green and black olive pizza. It was one of the best pizzas I&#39;ve ever tasted. So if you see that, and like olives, be sure to get it. What is also neat about this pizzeria is that the pizza changes constantly, so you don&#39;t know exactly what they might have (This is only for those who are walking in for a slice). So it&#39;s a little adventurous. I know they also have sandwiches, bread, and other goodies but the pizza is where its at. They also deliver, but only to certain areas. That&#39;s a bummer for suburbanites, but it&#39;s worth the trip down there. I can&#39;t remember if the pricing is descent, but it doesn&#39;t matter!! It&#39;s worth forking any amount of change.

I may be just one of the 1000+ reviews here for Little Star Pizza, but I do hope that my review will have some sort of weigh to it as I purposely seeked out &#34;The Best&#34; pizza joint in SF and I live down here in the nice &amp; sunny southern California area...<br><br>It was between either Little Star Pizza or Tony&#39;s Pizza Napoletana... Little Star won out this time due to the fact I didn&#39;t feel like going into the city on the way to Santa Rosa... but don&#39;t worry, next trip up to SF Tony&#39;s here I come...<br><br>So this is a tiny little pizza joint right offer Divisadero... it can be easily missed but just seek out the little star logo and you will be fine... the building is painting in dark colors but I&#39;m sure you will see people there for the food....<br><br>Let&#39;s start from the outside and work our way in...<br><br>Parking is metered like everywhere else in SF... very limited around the area so good luck... Nina R. and I visited this place at about 2:15pm so we scored a perfect parking spot right in front... however, $0.25 for 8 minutes???  Is &#34;The City&#34; that strapped for cash???  Sigh... I had no change so I had to ask the LS hostess for some change for parking...<br><br>Upon entering, the hostess was very nice and cordial and immediately get me the change I needed... so back out I went to pop some coins in for parking...(remember... bring lots of coins!!!  It&#39;s gonna run you about $3 bucks or so for sure!)<br><br>Place is dimly lit... about 10 tables or so... clean, quiet (during the time I was there), and pretty intimate.....<br><br>Bathroom was clean and artistic just like most of the places in SF....<br><br>So we went ahead and ordered the Spinach Feta/Mediterranean half and half pie (deep dish)...  <br><br>Be prepared.... it took 30 minutes for the pie to come out... yes it&#39;s hand freshly made to order, but man.... 30 minutes..... there is at least $1 out of parking already.....<br><br>When the pizza came out it was piping hot and cute!  It looked small but the small portion was filling enough for 2 people with left overs... the Spinach Feta was delicious and creamy while Mediterranean tasted healthy than it should be which is not a bad thing....<br><br>I do believe it was corn meal crusted... not my favorite cup of tea as I love them buttered up crust baked to crisp that tasted like a Danish butter cookie.... so Little Star take note.... get more butter on your crust please!!!<br><br>The bill came out to about $28 + $3 for one pizza... little steep but can&#39;t beat the experience...<br><br>So here&#39;s the Pros and Cons part...<br><br>Pros:  Tasty pizza, great service, nice atmosphere, clean bathroom...<br>Cons:  No parking, expensive price point<br><br>I would of given it a 3 star due to parking and the cost, but I did enjoy the experience and the food so bumping it up one star is very fair in my opinion....<br><br>Now that I&#39;ve tackled one of the top pizzeria in SF... I got to compare it to the other one on the other side of the town... Give them a try....

But I&#39;ll be the 1,567th person to give Little Star five stars, because it&#39;s wonderful.<br><br>I was very surprised by the size of the dining room. I expected smaller I guess. But it&#39;s deceiving from the street - you really can&#39;t see inside. Which is probably why I thought it was a secret society of some kind. And when I first walked in, I expected to feel like the least attractive, least hip person in the room (as I often do at places like this) but I was pleasantly surprised at the diversity. I even saw some blue collar folk. Fancy that. <br><br>The interior is seductive. Dark, design-y, neutral. And yet artsy. Which I dig. The wall art was painted on window panes (and if you know me you know about my fenestration fetish) so I took it as an omen (because I&#39;m nuts) and decided that this might be my new favorite restaurant. <br><br>But actually, it might qualify in more substantial categories, too. Like the service. Our waiter was probably the best I&#39;ve ever had, and that includes fancy downtown places. I don&#39;t know what his name was. I thought of asking him (&#34;Excuse me, sir, could I get your name to post on the internet?&#34;) but decided against it. Anyway, you&#39;ll know him if you get him.

So great for a work lunch or just a quick bite to escape the craziness of Soma/Downtown lunchtime chaos. They&#39;ve added long benches and tables outside too to accommodate larger groups. I love the menu, I really think you can&#39;t go wrong if you&#39;re in a group setting! My team has come here twice for work lunches and we&#39;ve all walked away happy and full. The starters are really practical and filling as well! Highlights include the burrata bruschetta, the kale &amp; romaine caesar (and trust me, I dislike kale, but this is so yummy with the pecorino and croutons), the heirloom beet salad is delicious and yummy for beet lovers like myself, and the meatballs in spicy marinara also are a crowd pleaser. They come in two (can order three) and are served with a generous portion of sauce paired with crusty toasted bread for dipping - heaven!!<br><br>The pizzas are obviously the real highlight here, so let&#39;s give them the credit they deserve. First of all, I love that you can add burrata to any pizza, that is just a wonderful option more places should get in the habit of doing! But back to the menu, the margherita pizza with burrata, the spicy fennel sausage, the prosciutto di parma/mozzrella/arugula pizza (could have less arugula), and the funghi misti/fontina are all worth trying. Good luck deciding! I&#39;ve also had the arancini which are nice and a side of the grilled steak which is simple and quite nice. This is the type of place that you want to keep coming back and trying everything on the menu, which I plan to do since there is a whole pasta and panini section that I&#39;ve never explored. <br><br>All around, really delicious food that is great for sharing or for two people. The atmosphere is fun, inviting, and clean - the only thing I wish was a bit better would be the service. Other than that, absolutely worth checking out Delarosa if you&#39;re in the mood for Italian and pizza, which should be always, because come&#39;on, it&#39;s the best!

I wish that they served real bread instead of the breadsticks because we were starving, but I guess that doesn&#39;t coincide with authentic Italian cuisine. We ended up having to Google a bunch of words off the menu because we had no idea what the ingredients were. We finally decided on Pecorino Lucano for an appetizer and Salsiccia for our pizza. And YUM did we make great choices! I highly recommend both. The appetizer came with a lot of cheese and it was a great pairing with the fava beans. The pizza was cooked perfectly and had just enough spice. The sausage, bell peppers, and onions were a great flavor combination and I would definitely order it again. Perfect size for two people.

I went with the Norello, and it was a great choice!<br><br>We started with the Eggplant caponatina with burrata. It was kind of alike a roasted vegetable salad (without greens). primarily eggplant but also some tomatoes and green olives which gave it a nice kick. Then the creamy burrata just adds extra deliciouness. Then we got the Dungeness crab arancini. They were like yummy little crab cake balls with an italian twist. For our pizza we got the Hot salami, coppa, tomato, diavolicchio. I also added burrata to our pizza (can you tell I LOVE burrata?!). First I love the diavolicchio (hot oil) - combind with the meats made it nice and spicy without being overly hot, but then adding the burrata added a creamy component to balance out the spicy. Great addition and totally doing it again. <br><br>For dessert we shared Coppa Mela (Vanilla gelato, scoop of apple pie, crème anglaise, spiced caramel sauce).

Simple ingredients, prepared well and combined meticulously. (kind of like burritos or donuts...different discussions). On quality alone, Tony&#39;s knocks it out of the park. The San Marzano tomato sauce, in particular, stood out for its floral taste (fresh, not too sweet), and the mozzarella was also very fresh. The dough was appropriately thin, yet retained its structure. My challenge is the cost. At $25, it is simply unacceptable. Tony&#39;s reputation is well known, and they are admired by tourists and locals alike. However, I cannot in good conscience give them a high rating when they are so very clearly milking it. Why do I say this? Two reasons, primarily: 1) at the end of the day, it&#39;s pizza. We&#39;re not talking some far-off delicacy where ingredients are hard to come by or we&#39;ve entered into Michelin star presentation. There is a ceiling to how much you can reasonably charge for pizza. And 2) perhaps more controversial, there are other options for equally well-executed Margherita pizza in SF, at substantially less cost (like, at least $10 less). One, in fact, not so far from Tony&#39;s.

We also got a side of the grilled asparagus, which didn&#39;t disappoint. It was generously covered in lardo butter and topped with crispy breadcrumbs and more proscuitto. Yum.

Once piping hot and sitting in front of me, the flavors worked so well together, I honestly think the presence cheese would have been a bit of a deterrent.

Of course, that&#39;s not to say I&#39;m complaining about spots that substitute Daiya cheese or some other cheese-but-not-really-cheese product, it&#39;s just that with ingredients this good, all you need are the plant based goods for a remarkable creation. <br><br>What makes it even better is that the pizzas are small enough to where if there&#39;s any contention over which pie will arrive on the table, it&#39;s quite possible for each person to order their own individual pizzas and avoid a crisis.

Though it isn&#39;t as good as New York pizza, it&#39;s about good as it gets outside of the East Coast.

The You Say Potato is also delicious, it has sliced gold potatoes, their pesto, and chunks of roasted garlic.

The mushroom is better. <br><br>The service is efficient and nice. They give free water very willingly. It doesnt have a bathroom which is sad, and is a little grungy.

I was searching for something, &amp; I thought the Internet could help me find my true match. I opened up my favorite site, Caviar, hoping to find the answer to my dilemma. I began to scroll through the photos, focusing on the &#34;type&#34; I was looking for tonight - Italian. Gorgeous photos of pizza were everywhere. But I&#39;d been through so many of them before. Sure, they were fine, but I was sure that tonight I could do better. Some were clearly gold-diggers (Tony &amp; his $45 pizza - yikes). I started to despair. Maybe this whole internet thing just isn&#39;t for me. Maybe I should just go old-school and call an old regular.<br><br>But remember, I&#39;m lazy so I persevered. Suddenly, I came upon Il Casaro Pizzeria &amp; Mozzarella Bar. The pictures were all I needed to see, not to mention the elevation of amazing mozzarellas in the very name. It was love at first sight. I could see us in Italy in a beautiful, romantic restaurant. I could use all the Italian words I know: per favore, Grazie, delizioso, formaggio, etc. <br><br>Arriving early, and not the worse for wear after the indignity of being shoved in a cardboard box for the trip across town, I was blown away by what came through my door.

So, I&#39;m here to say, do yourself a favor &amp; spend an evening with il Casaro.<br><br>P.S. I ordered the calzone (San Marzano tomatoes, smoked mozzarella, ham, &amp; mushrooms) and the imported Burrata. Both were outstanding.

Yay! We were promptly seated and our server came by and gave us the special for the day. We ordered the caprese salad and a small brass monkey.

I&#39;m so glad I followed fellow yelpers advice and ordered this! The sausage was yummy as well as the other toppings. I loved the crust and it did not get soggy like other deep dish pizzas I&#39;ve had in the past. The flavors worked well together and left me craving more after eating 2 slices.

The other winner goes to a popular pizza joint in NY. I&#39;ve never been to chicago, so i don&#39;t know how chicago pizza is. I do not like deep dish. I much prefer THIN crust pizza.<br><br>But whoa. This blew me away!<br><br>Got here on a late sunday afternoon, around 5.30pm. Parking wasn&#39;t good and had to park like 4 blocks away. It was surprisingly a full house for being 5.30pm. <br><br>Ordered the garlic bread and spicy wings, which was brought out speedily.<br><br>Garlic Bread, the bread was warm but nothing special. However, the butter was melted to perfection. The garlic was, well, a softened whole garlic, which is plenty for your bread and guaranteed stinky breaths!<br><br>Spicy chicken wings, a good portion, I didn&#39;t count how many, but i would presume there was around 10? delicious and didn&#39;t even need the ranch! However, by the time I had finished these (shared) I was regretting the order of 2 appetisers.<br><br>The pizza took about an additional 10 minutes. I didn&#39;t think it looked big, only 12&#34; long (that&#39;s what she said =p) By long, i mean in diameter! But after the first slice, even if you skip the crust...you remember, it is a deep dish with an overload of ingredients on it, leaving the quest to finish the pizza to be a very daunting task. Actually, impossible after eating the two appetisers. I only managed to squeeze in 2 slices and was full for the next 12 hours. Meanwhile, my bf finished 3 slices. The pizza was indeed, very well made. The crust wasn&#39;t soggy at all. The best of the pizza was somewhat crunchy and a great foundation for the pizza. I personally preferred the Little Star, even though it lacked the meat, it was filling enough. the Mediterranean chicken had a little sourness from the artichoke and i didn&#39;t think it matched well. Overall though, incredibly well made! Water, which was essential, was refilled every so often. <br><br>What&#39;s even more amazing was that after 3 days, I had 3 slices of pizza left. I microwaved a slice for 1 minute and toasted it in my toaster oven for another 10 minutes in 350 degree. It was still very good! Not soggy at all! Amazing!<br><br>They accept card now!!! Thank goodness! But the ATM is only $0.25 anyways.<br><br>***<br><br>Tips: Get the little star, get the garlic bread, get the wings, dare i say one of the best wings and pizza ever! One appetizer to share, with a large pizza is enough for 2! Leftovers aren&#39;t that bad. Get half and half!

The cheese was cooked at the right temperature cause when I took a bite out of it the mozzarella was nice and stringy. The tomatoes were perfectly cooked.

I don&#39;t like it when waiters are overly attentive but this guy paid no attention to us at all. <br><br>We forgot to mention we wanted two checks, but since the check was hand written and clearly not entered into a machine, we thought we would tell him what to put on card and the rest would be cash. He got very upset with us and told us it would take him a long time because we didn&#39;t tell him beforehand. I would understand if he had to enter information into a machine and it had to reprint but he hand wrote it and we were trying to tell him what we wanted on one card and the rest cash. He was very stubborn and rude about it.<br><br>When he brought it back and saw we were paying 1 check by card he got upset we weren&#39;t paying cash. He said &#34;he just likes cash.&#34; <br><br>This guy was so rude, stubborn, and did not serve us at all. I don&#39;t know why we tipped him as well as we did. We are nice people who are usually understanding when people have bad days but the more I think about it, the more I realize how unnecessary his bad attitude was. I tried to sympathize with him, maybe we should have remembered to let him know we were splitting checks (only 2 ways) but even if we were wrong, do you really want to treat your customers like they are putting you out? Are you not being paid to serve us? I always feel bad getting angry with bad service but it&#39;s unacceptable to be in the customer service business and treat your customers so poorly. <br><br>I came here because friends of mine recommended but I will never go back.

As a New Yorker i have a pretty high standard for Pizza but not an inflexible one. There are many great pizzeria&#39;&#39;s in the bay area - Pizzaiolo, Little Star, etc.....Pizzeria Delfina is not one of them. To me the sauce is the biggest culprit - it taste&#39;s like a budget brand of canned tomato sauce (think from the dented can aisle) and just ends up making the crust soggy. The pizza&#39;s are also a little too spartan lacking any kind of visual presentation or flair. The best part of going there to me is the solid Italian sourced wine list which is reasonably priced with many choices.

I walked in as a single and spoke to the first person that greeted me. I asked if I would be able to order and finish my pizza in 45 minutes since I had a doctor appointment nearby. She said yes and I then asked where I could sit. I mistakenly thought she said anywhere including the booth since there were plenty of other tables or the counter. I placed my coat and umbrella in a booth and went to the restroom. When I returned another woman evidently the hostess said I couldn&#39;t sit in the booth which was meant for a larger party. Which makes sense and totally understand. I mentioned to her I thought the person who I spoke with (evidently a waitress) said  I could sit anywhere but I was fine in moving. What got me upset as she was walking away she muttered that the waitress never told me that.  Basically calling me a liar. I know she hadn&#39;t asked the waitress. I summoned the waitress and asked if I misheard her. She was courteous and said she didn&#39;t offer the booth and was just miscommunication. I told her even though I was in the wrong the hostess didn&#39;t need to have a condescending attitude and should learn some customer service skills and tact. I have been to this particular location many times and have always enjoyed their pizza and service.  She said she will mention my feelings to the hostess. Other than that the waitress who did serve me provided excellent service and the pizza was great as usual and served quickly. It&#39;s a shame that the first person a customer usually see first is the hostess and that greeting can help or ruin the entire dining experience.

Instead of telling the truth that they forgot or haven&#39;t started the order, we were told 3 times that our order will be ready in minutes, while waiting another 10 to 15m, we saw the employee tell another employee to prepare our to-go order. Why even have a to-go setup if you have to wait that long after one places an order. And, how about telling the truth, instead of making customers wait with false hope of only few minutes.", "reviewer_name": "Brian J.", "page": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/tonys-pizza-napoletana-san-francisco?osq=pizza"},

Seriously, if you&#39;re in a rush or just in need of a quick bite, this place is not for you. Tony&#39;s pizzas are meant to be enjoyed, and the crazy long waits ensure you&#39;ll have to work for that pleasure.<br><br>But waiting there is half the trouble.

Oh, San Francisco, how cruel you can be...<br><br>The actual food, once it&#39;s finally your turn to sit, is delicious. Huge and delicious. I&#39;ve had the Little Italy Salad for $12, the Tartufo Pizza for $26 (mozzarella, goat cheese, mushrooms, truffles, prosciutto, and arugula), and the New Haven Lou Pizza with meatballs for $30 (mozzarella, ricotta, spinach, garlic, and red peppers). Pricey, which is to be expected. The Little Italy Salad was your typical house salad, with a few extra elements like chopped olives, walnuts, gorgonzola, and cherry tomatoes. <br><br>The pizzas had a thinner crust and were both so filling. The New Haven Lou is especially huge -- like 16 inches -- and meant to serve 2-4 people.

Sure, maybe you caught one of the employees on a bad day or mom didn&#39;t make you Mickey Mouse shaped pancakes this morning so your day was off to a terrible start but I can&#39;t think of one thing wrong with this place. Well, it felt slightly cramped but, it&#39;s in San Francisco-- what do you expect?<br><br>The pizza here is awesome, plain and simple. I&#39;m not one of those &#34;pizza experts&#34; from Chicago, or New York or whatever who claims that a pizza joint isn&#39;t as good as that hole in the wall Greasy Eddie&#39;s on the corner of 5th and Pretentious in some slum on the east coast. All I know is this pizza is good. Really good. <br><br>I, of course, went with the deep-dish style because after I tried that, I never thought of thin crust again. The deep-dish crust is probably the best part of the pizza. I had a veggie pizza with spinach, garlic, and mushrooms--- perfect. The sauce, while it could stand a few more spices thrown in, was also perfect. I used to be a die-hard Patxi&#39;s fan but that might be changing...<br><br>The garlic bread-- what can I say about this garlic bread... they give you a sourdough roll sliced. In a separate container you get butter and olive oil whipped together and then a whole BULB of roasted garlic. You spread it all on the bread yourself and it is glorious. I think I liked it even more than the pizza to be honest. <br><br>The beer is a little overpriced but, beer and pizza is like PB and J so, I had to go for it anyway. <br><br>The atmosphere and service were awesome. We hardly waited at all for anything to come out after we ordered it and we were seated within 2 minutes. Granted, it was a Thursday evening so I don&#39;t know what the weekends are like but, still impressive. <br><br>The dark and velvety atmosphere is perfect. Although you are fairly exposed and close to everyone else, it doesn&#39;t really feel like it. It is both communal and intimate. <br><br>As for parking... again, it&#39;s San Francisco.

I was never wowed. Don&#39;t get me wrong, it&#39;s deep dish and as Stephen Baldwin said, &#34;Even when it&#39;s bad, it&#39;s still pretty good.&#34;<br><br>But those delightful pies were still missing something, even on their hometurf. When you have &#34;Chicago-style deep dish&#34; at Little Star or Zachary&#39;s, for example, the ingredients taste fresher, the pie is less oily, and the whole experience is just overall... tastier.<br><br>Now, to touch upon the Zachary&#39;s vs Little Star face-off. Not necessary. They&#39;re two different styles of deep dish, and although inherently stem from the same wonderful Chicago origin, they&#39;re tough to compare, much less compete. Little Star is much more like its Chicago roots than Zachary&#39;s -- it&#39;s a little more shallow and has flattened the ingredients internally -- some purists actually prefer that, as they think Zachary&#39;s is &#34;too jumbly in there,&#34; allowing the extra ingredients to hop around too much.<br><br>The real difference, however, is the crust. Little Star has that cornmeal crust... that&#39;s really what it comes down to. If you prefer that, you&#39;re a Little Star fan &#39;til the end. But if you prefer a more traditional wheat crust while still prefering the &#34;Chicago-style&#34; to ACTUAL Chicago, then Zachary&#39;s is the place for you.<br><br>LONG story short, Little Star is delish, just not my preference.

Knowing that it&#39;s located in the Northbeach area, u know that parking is going to take forever, and the wait was going to be forever too. We got here at around 8 on a Friday night and had to wait for around 45min.<br><br>The restaurant itself is a bit small but pretty cozy. It&#39;s not fancy but gives you a warm and family-esque feeling. The waiters are also very nice. Between the 5 of us, we shared:<br><br>+ANTIPASTO: prosciutto with all kinds of meet. very tasty cuz i&#39;ve always been a fan of this dish. Has a good amount, I&#39;d say perfect for a group of 5-6ppl.<br>+FRIED CALAMARI: veryyyy delicious!! they fry it JUST RIGHT and just tastes super fresh and yummy! Definitely highly recommended to get as an appetizer!<br>+DELUXE PIZZA: their pizzas are definitely the highlight of this place. they&#39;ve got a huge selection, and considering we had a bigger group, we decided to get the one with everything on it. The bread is medium thick and the ingredients were very delicious. Could have used a bit more cheese but I&#39;d definitely say that they make VERY GOOD PIZZAS!<br>+SPAGHETTI WITH CLAMS IN WHITE SAUCE: we substituted the linguini with spaghetti. This dish was very delicious, but I&#39;d say that their pastas aren&#39;t the greatest, and they&#39;re not very big portions either. The clam sauce was very yummy, it was what made this pasta.<br>+MACARONI WITH SAUSAGE &amp; MUSHROOMS: the sausage was veryyyy delicious, but I&#39;m not a fan of their macaroni. expected it to be cooked more to be warmer and softer, but it was a bit on the hard end. didn&#39;t quite meet my expectations.<br><br>These 5 things definitely stuffed us up like crazy. Their pizzas are pretty big and definitely what I recommend the most. I would say that I&#39;m slightly disappointed that they don&#39;t give you oil and vinegar for the bread.

I&#39;d totally pay $$$ for a parking lot but there was unfortunately none nearby. I guess this is what needed to be done in order to simply grab a slice of the famous Clam Garlic pizza.<br><br>The Clam Garlic pizza. Sounds so unique and so interesting... well, it did taste very unique and interesting just like you&#39;d imagine. There was surprisingly tons of garlic on the pizza which I absolutely loved because I love garlic, but I prefer to have clams and garlic with my pasta or soup dishes. Or maybe it&#39;s because the clam was room temperature so my pizza wasn&#39;t really hot? As you all know, the best pizza is always really hot with stringy cheese after each bite. Yum. :0) Dunno, but a regular italian sausage combo pizza from Pizza My Heart would&#39;ve probably fulfilled my pizza craving for that night. <br><br>Restaurant is extremely small - maybe about 10 bar style seats. Expect to doggy bag your pizza and eat it at home, which TONS of people do! Maybe you can throw it in the microwave too.<br><br>P.S. Check out the bathroom!

First of all, this place is L-O-U-D. Don&#39;t come here on a first date because you&#39;ll be yelling at each other. The decor is great and the service friendly. The food came out quickly, which is always a plus!<br><br>Burrata Bruschetta (4/5) - Drizzled with honey, hazelnuts, and cracked pepper. Only two slices. Delicious, but I wish the burrata wouldn&#39;t have been cold. The warm bread called from warm cheese! <br><br>Kale Caesar (1/5)- I had this at the Marina location and was happy to order it again. It came way overdressed and I didn&#39;t even eat more than a few bites because it tasted like dressing soup. The couple next to me ordered it too and they had the same problem. <br><br>Spicy Fennel Sausage (4/5)- I love Delarosa pizza! The sauce is more of a stewed tomato taste, as opposed to a marinara-based sauce. Light on the cheese. The menu listed it as having &#34;onions&#34;, which turned out to be spring onions that I picked off because they were big hunks (not the cute ringed slices used as garnish). I think sauteed onions would have been tastier, but maybe some people would like this?<br><br>Overall- I&#39;d go again for a special occasion and I&#39;d recommend you give it a try.", "reviewer_name": "Hanine C.", "page": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/delarosa-san-francisco-3?osq=pizza"},

When we arrived, we still waited yet another 30, but we were happy at the bar. I knew my father would love their extensive beer list. I was right, he loved it.<br><br>As soon as we sat down our waitress was super helpful. She even brought us 3 complimentary appetizers and thanked us for waiting so long! Can you believe it? And they were phenomenal!<br><br>My father loved it so much, including the price, that he wanted to take us all back again the following Sunday. Again, we received excellent service and a complimentary pizza. Where did these people come from? <br><br>We all fell in love. My brother&#39;s girlfriend forgot her ID and when I went back to get it a few days later I told the manager how impressed we were.

This place has won Best of the Bay- Pizza for at least the last 3 straight years. I went for my first time recently and was beyond impressed by everything except the décor. The place opens at 5pm, but since there was a big party that day, they had their door open at 4:30pm. As the party was walking in, I walked in and was seated immediately. None of this, &#34;We aren&#39;t officially open, so you&#39;ll have to wait,&#34; crap you&#39;d get at pretty much any other restaurant. I was very impressed by this.<br><br>The rest of the lunch/dinner went great. Even though there were at least 20 people in the big party, another table with 2 people, and then my 2 top, we were treated just the same as we would be if we were the only people in the restaurant. I think they only had 2 servers at the time, so again, impressive. I got the Little Star pizza because it&#39;s good to order the dish named after the restaurant and I&#39;m not big on meat (spinach, feta, ricotta, mushrooms, onions, garlic). It was amazing. The crust was great and the tomatoes on top were so unbelievably fresh. I&#39;ve been to Uno&#39;s in Chicago and I like Little Star better. Yeah, I said it. One thing I read in the comments was that the crust was buttery- I disagree. I thought the pizza crust was going to be like eating a croissant, but it wasn&#39;t. Just the cornmealy goodness you would expect. By the way, the pizza heats up great, too.<br><br>The only MINOR issue with the place is that black curtains cover the windows and walls. The bar looks good, but maybe something else can be done. In the evening, the sun shines right into the windows, so maybe the curtains are really necessary. Who cares.

After waiting for 45 minutes for our table ( write your name on a chalkboard and hope everyone leaves quickly ) we sat down and ordered a bottle of Aglianico. Someone brought the bottle already uncorked and put it in front of us without asking for a taste. It was unusual for an upscale place but it usually happens in Italy as waiters drop carafs of wine in front of  you and depart so I dismissed this fact in good spirit. When we poured the wine ourselves and tasted, it was iced cold. The very friendly waitress just came by an inquired about the wine. When I said it was too cold and offered her to feel the bottle, she dismissed me with a smile telling me that all wine is kept at perfect temperature in their cooler and if it s too cold it will warm up at our table.Nice...I did not bother to argue that you do not do it to a $40 bottle of wine and instead we ordered appetizersand pizza. Food came fairly quickly and Buratta was melting in my mouth; the Tuna salad was superb and the 4 cheeses pizza was delicious.

I would go to school, and my every day my teachers would have to talk to my parents about how it seemed like the smell of garlic seemed to run from my pores. But hey. I was a happy camper because I was being fed my aunt&#39;s delicious pastas, hearty Sicilian breakfasts, and homemade marinara, broccoli and pesto sauces. <br><br>I never thought I could experience Italian food better than Aunt Vicki&#39;s until I came to Tommaso&#39;s. Well.. sort of. (I only say sort of because I feel like a traitor)... But seriously. <br><br>I came to Tommaso&#39;s because of all of the good things I heard about it from my boyfriend. He lives in the Bay Area, and this is one of his most favorite restaurants in all of San Francisco, and pretty much overall. So, I decided that I wanted to treat him to a night out in the city. Being avid Yelpers, we meandered the other Yelp pictures from Tommaso&#39;s to gain some insight on what to order. Here&#39;s what caught our eye: the fried calamari (a staple, obviously), pesto ravioli, and pepperoni/mushroom pizza. <br><br>But before I get on with the food, let&#39;s talk about the experience. First off, unless you plan on using public transportation to get here or you want to pay $15 for public parking, plan on arriving about 20 minutes early to find proper parking. I mean, it is San Francisco, so you&#39;re going to have to wait a decent amount of time to find a spot along the street withing a two-block radius of this place. We found a street spot, and had to walk a little distance before arriving there. During our walk, we were somewhat caught off-guard by the scantily-clad women standing outside the strip clubs they worked in. But honestly, it wasn&#39;t a big deterrent; step out of your comfort zone. But no. Seriously. Tommaso&#39;s is surrounded by San Francisco&#39;s infamous &#34;happy ending&#34; massage parlors, strip clubs, and adult entertainment retail shops. Tommaso&#39;s really is a little gem located in the midst of all of this. <br><br>We finally arrived. No windows or any clue to what lay on the inside. As we walked in, I was pleasantly surprise by the super-tiny dining area. Seating for about 20 parties of 4, max. It had the cutest little Italian vibe to it. Murals on the walls, white wooden framework on the booths.<br><br>The service is honestly some of the best I&#39;ve had. The waitress (who I&#39;m assuming had some sort of affiliation with the owner) was not pushy at all, yet so attentive and never kept us waiting. There are also a few other people who will come to the table (to deliver bread, take dirty plates, fill water, etc.) and they are all very attentive and polite as well. <br><br>Anyhow, we started out with the calamari as I mentioned. Tommaso&#39;s calamari was the best I had ever eaten. It is the perfect consistency. Not rubbery at all: you can bite a piece in half without trying to struggle. I also loved how they served it with some of their warm marinara sauce. It really was the perfect combination and start to our meal. <br><br>Just as a tip: If you order a drink (i.e. soda) they charge by the can, so make sure you&#39;re wise about your drinks, we ended up paying $10 for 2 sodas plus a refill for each cup!<br><br>Anyhow. My boyfriend and I then shared a pizza and pasta. First came the pasta. We ordered the cheese ravioli with pesto sauce. Seriously. This was the best thing I have ever eaten. In my entire life. The pasta was homemade, and cooked to perfection. The ricotta cheese on the inside was fluffy and billowy and perfect. The pesto wasn&#39;t too garlicy, oily, or basil-y. It was the perfect combination of all ingredients and was very light. Not to mention, the pasta that we shared came out on two plates. Each plate (1/2 of the order) was big enough to be my complete meal. By this time I was already stuffed, but the pizza was on it&#39;s way out. <br><br>The pizza came out and it was honestly tastebud tantalizing! It was half pepperoni and mushroom and half ricotta and meatball. Forcing to find room in my already-full tummy, I just had one piece (the pepperoni and mushroom). I know this has been over-used in my review, but the pizza was literally the best I&#39;ve ever eaten. Warm, thin crust, with an abundance of toppings. My favorite part of the pizza, though, was the dough/crust. Never have I ever tasted pizza crust like that before. You can just tell that it is homemade and cooked to crispy perfection. <br><br>We initially planned on getting dessert, but at this point I was already popping the seams of my dress! I couldn&#39;t possibly fit anything else into my tummy. We got our check, sat for a bit, and then bid Tommaso&#39;s a farewell for the night. <br><br>Anyhow, to wrap up this novel, I do have to say that Tommaso&#39;s makes my list of top five places to eat, and number one Italian place. <br><br>Food Quality: 11/10<br>Service: 10/10 <br>Ambiance: 10/10<br>Prices (a little pricey, but worth it!): 9/10 <br><br>Will I go back?

Ive been trying to get out of my usual dining routines and decided to allow my friend to choose where we ate at. I must admit this second visit was great! <br>The first time I came to Delarosa was on a thursday night. The place was packed and I had to wait about 30 minutes standing by the bathroom before we got seated. This time around I walked in on a beautiful day and sat down immediately. No wait! Also the windows were open letting the fresh air breeze through the restaurant. A great touch. <br>Now on to the food. We started with the Calamari. It was great! It also came with a bunch of different veggies that were fried up in the crispy crumbs that covered the calamari. Some of the veggies, like the onion, were a tad strange but still worth the try. <br>For my main course I got the Pappardelle Napoletana. This is an amazing pasta dish consisting of a tomato based sauce, cheese and shredded pork. Even better is that the dishes here are not huge. Some places you go the portions are so big you end up over eating and feeling gross after. Not here. The portion size was great. For $10 you got about a fistful of a portion, perfect size especially after an appetizer. The Pappardelle Napoletana was great too! Definitely want to come back and have that again. My amazing friend got the black Olive Gnocchi with Rock Shrimp and she thoroughly enjoyed it. Sometimes myself and seafood dont get along so i didnt try hers but it defintly looked appetizing.<br>All in all this was a great experience!!

That being said, I wanted to be the 1100th review for this place.<br><br>I&#39;ll admit to not being a good Yelper by posting a review sooner when I first became addicted to this place&#39;s baked goods (literally have never had a bad item, and that&#39;s after eating what seems like 1000 pounds of their daily pizzas, focaccias, cheese rolls, breadsticks, muffins, brioche knots, coffee cakes, provolone onion rolls, cakes, and cookies). The straw that broke my metaphorical camel&#39;s back to have me write this review is my discovery of their apple pie, a seasonal treat for holidays such as July 4th. I balked when the register rang up $28 for the whole pie but the moment I took a bite, after nuking it for 1 minute, I realized I could&#39;ve paid $40 for it and still be satisfied. Every bit of the crust, which we all know is the best part of the pie, was buttery. The key to knowing this was a delicious pie was that I was also eating the apple stuffing, which in most pies I pick to the side because I only like the crust. The place has found a way to make the apple stuffing taste like the crust. I admit to devouring almost 1/3 of it within a 24 hour period. Do not let a holiday go without getting a pie from Arizmendi. And having typed all that, I can now go to eat the other 2/3 of the pie.", "reviewer_name": "Gwen L.", "page": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/arizmendi-bakery-san-francisco?osq=pizza"},

We ended up getting the fresh buffalo mozzarella app which came with fresh baked bread, arugula drizzled with evoo and cherry tomatoes. It was beyond amazing, clearly very fresh cheese! It was everything and more. Loved the Calabrian chili oil at the table. We also ordered the four cheese pizza (Mozzarella, goat cheese, asiago, gorgonzola), and added mushrooms to it.

We had decided we wanted to eat in the neighborhood, but had no real plans, so we just strolled around for a bit. After passing by once, we stopped in again and were pretty impressed with the mood (the huge row of beers on tap on the wall confirmed this for me) and the menu (neither of us really wanted to go to an expensive hole-in-the-wall).<br><br>We were seated pretty promptly and quickly ordered the beet carpaccio salad, malloreddus with lamb ragu, and the pizza with hot salami, coppa, tomatoes, and diavolicchio sauce. The salad was my favorite part of the night, with a nice balance between bitter greens and sweet beets (both golden and red) that was tempered by the earthiness of some truffle and ricotta shavings. The pasta was a notch above average, but the portion size was perfect for sharing. The pizza was a bit of a hit-or-miss, depending on which slice you had. One side was in that gray area between deliciously crispy and frustratingly burnt, but the overall texture of the dough was nice. They bill their pizzas a &#34;Roman-style&#34;, which accounts for the thin pie you&#39;ll encounter here, but the toppings are a clear sign of a modern, San Franciscan culinary pedigree. All the cured meats did get a bit oily on my pizza, but sometimes you just want a nice meaty slice of pie, right?<br><br>There&#39;s little chance of this becoming my go-to pizza joint (Little Star still holds that distinction), but if I come back, I&#39;m definitely making a bee-line for the bar. Access to a wall of beers on tap, absinthe, and a ton of great top-shelf liquor? No sitting next to a too-loud baby or having to ignore businessman blathering on trying to impress the girl on a date or accidentally getting shoved by the nice (but cramped) wait staff?

We placed our wine order, which came out in a timely fashion and was pretty good, but when we put in our pizza order, they forgot to make it....twice. After about 40 minutes or so, we asked the server (who was also the hostess) how much longer it would take. Since the kitchen is open air so everyone can see in, we witnessed a brief, yet terse argument between our server and the kitchen staff. She came back and said it should be only a few more minutes, but it was pretty obvious they forgot to make it. After about another 30 minutes or so, still no pizza. We flagged down our server and asked AGAIN how long it would be. She went back for fight-with-kitchen-staff #2, which was in plain view. She came back and said it would just be a few minutes, but they clearly forgot to make it....again. It finally came out about 5-10 minutes later and the dough was clearly undercooked. If you&#39;re going to take over an hour to make a damn pizza, at least make it right. This place could be a good pizza joint; the chef knew what he was doing with the dough and the pizzas certainly had potential, but there was a severe lack of communication between the serving staff and the kitchen staff that makes this place a real mess.

I have been going to dinner there for about 15 years and I do not think much has changed since then. The good news is that little change means consistency and in the case of Tommaso&#39;s that means consistently solid, no frills old-school Italian food. <br>Although some tourists flock here because of it&#39;s history as the first pizza place on the West Coast, it is typically much less crowded than nearby Tony&#39;s and has pizza that is almost, if not just as good. Also, they usually give you a glass of wine while you wait, which is never not a good thing. <br>In terms of recommendations, the Spaghetti and Meatballs is always good, mostly because their meatballs are excellent. When you combine that with their pizza and its crisp, soft-on-the-inside crust, the resulting Meatball Pizza is fairly unreal. If you want pizza, just order it. It&#39;s good. <br>Lastly, no true dinner outing is complete unless you order dessert, so you have to go with the tiramisu. It comes in a bowl, which I thought was weird at first, but then I tried it and realized that all other tiramisus (tiramisai?) are weird for not coming in bowls. You won&#39;t be disappointed.<br>If you want consistent, authentic Italian food/pizza, go to Tommaso&#39;s. Even the policemen eat here, so that must mean something. Plus all the streetlights outside are neon and shaped like women, so there&#39;s that as well.", "reviewer_name": "Andrew S.", "page": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/tommaso-ristorante-italiano-san-francisco-2?osq=pizza"},

Even an Iron Chef could not smirk at this action.  Cafe Sport is great, (just up the hill on Green) but this is even better. It will make you feel like BizMarkee when he finally got an personal invitation to the Grammies.  So, we went there with three people, and wow was the food and service great. Truth be told, this is not a five star interior of a restaurant, but it is home-like, rustic, and very comfortable.  I think I have eaten at every north beach Italian eatery and this is bar far the best.  &#34;Who am I to talk you may ask?&#34; &#34;Well, I&#39;m not the one looking for advice on Yelp now am I!&#34;  So listen grasshopper, here&#39;s the scene: one long table divides the middle of the dinning room, while happy conversations, scrumptious smells permeate the air.  Tommaso&#39;s specialty (since 1934) is the pizza, but we decided to go right for the appetizing salads, pasta, and tasty Tommaso Ristorante Italiano&#39;s Shiraz house wine.  We started with their fresh baked bread, and fresh tomato and soft mozzarella salad. My girlfriend, who had gone to the dentist the same day, was having a hard time chewing the amazing fresh bread that they served us, and after we told this to the server she quickly went back and grabbed us some delicious marinara sauce to accompany the bread.  Wow, was the sauce fine.  I&#39;m talking like G love &amp; special sauce good.  I had the pasta with shrimp, garlic, clams, tomatoes, for my main shin dig and it was served in a delectable spicy red sauce.

We narrowed it down to two 4 stars restaurants and saw that Tony&#39;s had a line out the door and the other was not very busy.  I was a little concerned about time but my wife said there has to be a good reason for that line and &#34;OH&#34; was there!  <br><br>There was a wait of 30 minutes and we decided to have dessert first and went to a close by gelato store.  We then found a place to hang out and I read the Yelp reviews on Tony&#39;s.  We narrowed down our order to a giant meatball and their special Marguerite  pizza (if either were available as they were limited to 25-75 per day)! We were seated outside and a very knowledgeable and friendly waiter reviewed the many types of pizza available.  We were tempted to try an exotic one, but I held firm on the seemingly simple pizza made with the best ingredients.  We also ordered their gigantic meatball and my wife added a cream mushroom sauce based on our servers recommendation.  I wasn&#39;t too sure as I am not normally a fan of cream sauces but I&#39;d give it a try as my wife agreed to my Marguerite pizza suggestion.<br><br>We were relaxing in the sun when a close to softball size meatball covered with a delicious looking marinara sauce arrived.  The server then poured a thick white creamy Mushroom sauce over it turning the sauce to the color of a pink vodka sauce. The taste was amazing! The meatball was moist and packed with flavor especially with that sauce that we were now fighting over with our spoons!  <br><br>The Marguerite pizza then arrived.  The taste was extraordinary, packed with flavor that I needed to slow down to savor! The balance of sauce, cheese and crust was perfect and the crust alone made a great swab for the remaining sauce from the meatball.

We ordered appetizers and a main course. I can&#39;t recall the names, but i took pics. My husband is a carnivore and swooned over the meatballs and chicken Parm over pasta. <br><br>3) THE EXPERIENCE: we arrived about 10pm<br>on a Saturday night. It was still a little lively, but the cleanup/wind down effort was beginning (they close at 11pm or 11:30pm on Saturday). Nonetheless, we didn&#39;t feel rushed.

Check this place out if you&#39;re looking for Italian and good wine. THANKS SO MUCH for making our last night in town memorable. Tip: This is a small restaurant and seems to get really busy.

If you have a hankering for a great doughy, chewy, flavorful slice of garlic/clam, sausage, pepperoni, or vegetarian pizza give this place a shot. The slices are light on crust, big on flavor and they disappear down your gullet with a dangerous amount of ease. To optimize your pizza tasting, plan on ordering at least a slice of each flavor and split each slice into two, they are big enough to do so.<br><br>You are likely to encounter a line that goes out the door and down the block but don&#39;t be discouraged. Part of the reason for the long line is that the ordering counter is right next to the entrance, so unless you are next up to order you will be out the door already; they also crank those crack laced puppies out fairly fast, so the line moves at a pretty good pace.", "reviewer_name": "Jose U.", "page": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/golden-boy-pizza-san-francisco?osq=pizza"},

All my favorite veggies--zucchini? yes please!--plus the pepperoni and sausage on a hearty, substantive but not-too-doughy focaccia crust.

For some, this may have been an irritation, however to us, this signaled an excellent dinner choice! :) While we were waiting the hostess provided us with beer and wine, which definitely made the wait insignificant. Once seated, the nicest waitress ever, Cindy, came over to greet us and take our order. Given we were in the area to try new things, we asked her what her favorites were. She listed several items, however she made sure to highlight the lasagna as one of their best dishes. We took her recommendations and ordered the Italian pepperoni pizza with spinach and fresh shaved Parmesan on top as well as the lasagna. Wow. The pizza was crispy, cheesy and very flavorful. Though it was tasty, our favorite by far was the lasagna. Fresh made in house, the first bite will literally melt in your mouth!! There is some serious witchcraft in how tasty it was!

You sit elbow-to-elbow with your neighbors on small square stools, leaving little to no room for your jacket, purse, etc. The space on the table for your food is equally as tight and your server will stand over you uncomfortably while taking your order.

Since Tony won in a competition in Napoli the award for best pizza (2007 I think?) it is mentioned as the best pizza Napolitana in the world? But is it?<br><br>We tried two pizzas: Margherita (Neapolitan pizza) and Sausage and Stout. Obviously the reason I came here was for their Margherita which they say they only make 75 a day because of ingredients brought from Italy. <br><br>I am a huge fan of Neapolitan pizza so I&#39;ve been trying to find the best one in the Bay Area since I moved here and I would say that in my opinion though good this is not the best in the city. And not the cheapest either. <br><br>The pizza is pretty good but just not the best. Though my review might seem overly negative it&#39;s just because of how famous the place is, expectations are high!<br><br>Are you a tourist or wanna check it off of your list so you can brag about having eaten the best pizza in the world?

This is the fourth time I have been treated poorly and they don&#39;t seem to care. The first 3x, we have had our orders take hours to get because of supposed shift changes. This time, the man at the podium upon arrival was talking loudly at my brother who didn&#39;t know there is no reservations taken while we had a party of 15 people including children. There were several tables open outside, they were sitting people as they came in, so no wait, and when I tried to speak up over my brother the man started yelling &#34;we don&#39;t work under this kind of pressure.&#34; WTH? Maybe the wrong person to work your front door but the right person to rid your restaurant of a large party of 15 people. However we stayed, waited an hour and the hostess was leaving and said she had indoor tables. We couldn&#39;t take the indoor tables due to Covid and so we got told the next shift could handle me. Seriously? Been there and done that on a single pizza order as stated 3x already. Crappy service, had to leave after over an hour of this nonsense, couldn&#39;t update us on our wait while sitting people as they come in. We drive very far to go to the east bay Slice House often and give them plenty of business there. Because people working there are normal. Tony&#39;s doesn&#39;t care because there will be 15 more people in the door to pay them so what do they care how they treat you. They don&#39;t care!

The pasta was good, but the pizza here was fantastic! We had the special pizza with pancetta and leeks and since they are well known for the spinach pizza we made this one half and half and then ordered a straight up Italian pepperoni pizza. Delizioso! Make sure you save room for a couple very special desserts. I am not a tiramisu fan but the one here is incredible. It does not have any alcohol taste and it is more like a pudding - it is so velvety smoothe.

We picked Tommaso&#39;s because we had just bought a restaurant review book at City Lights, and were reading it at Vesuvio&#39;s. We weren&#39;t disappointed. The pizza we ordered that rainy day was perfection. Years later we moved to San Francisco, and Tommaso&#39;s has become a regular hang out for us. We still get the wine of the month (Augustino knows wine!) and an anchovy pizza, just like we did that rainy day almost twenty years ago. It&#39;s heavenly. My wife and I spend a lot of time in Italy, and this is real Italian style pizza. The salads are huge, and splitting them for two is a good way to start. The antipasto is great, too, and my wife is partial to the calamari. For something different, try the lasagna--also fantastic. The staff have a tough time getting the crowd in and out, but they always find the time to stop by and ask about us and our travels. This is, for us, San Francisco&#39;s best restaurant.

Closer enough to fisherman wharf to be a good option to get a bite away from the pier", "reviewer_name": "Jon'Michael F.", "page": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/golden-boy-pizza-san-francisco?osq=pizza"},

I ordered 2 slices: Combo &amp; Garlic and Clams<br><br>I enjoy thin crust pizza, but GB&#39;s thick crust was really good! The pizza crust is a little dense, not too doughy thankfully, but it still had that nice crisp to it, esp on the edges. For the Garlic&amp;Clam, it tasted kinda bland to me. I was really looking forward to it since I love both garlic &amp; clams, but sadly, it did not live up to its hype. Maybe I should&#39;be toasted it to enhance the flavors. The winner, however, was the Combo! Great flavors w/ the sausage, zuchinni, onions&amp;tomatos; not too cheesy but jst enough; and good tomato sauce, not your Prego basic kind.<br><br>Overall, awesome pizza and will definitely come back to get their Combo &amp; other kinds of pizza. Definitely check it out when in North Beach.

My wife and I love beretta and Delarosa did not disappoint. We enjoyed all the pizzas, though the crust on the artichoke pizza was slightly over done and the egg was not centered (it was basically all on one slice).

The middle was raw, the crust was burnt, there was too much sauce so it was greasy as shit, and the cheese was like a rubbery ball sitting on the pizza (and it slid off).

The slices are all way below $ 5.00 for all the pizza slices most ranging about $ 3.00 to $ 4.00 per slice. My boss and I went for lunch time and I had never been so Golden Boy Pizza it was. Since I work in North Beach we frequent many of the restaurants and eateries in North Beach. Who doesn&#39;t love pizza right? <br><br>Since it was lunch time during the work week the vibe was calm and laid back. We went up and sat at the bar to watch all the wonderful pizzas come out. I knew I wanted to try the infamous Clams and Garlic pizza and I also selected the combination as well. The slices are quite large and packed with toppings the crust was flavorful and had a thicker crust. The combination came from straight out of the oven which was one of the reasons why I chose it. <br><br>You can rest assured the pizza doesn&#39;t &#34;sit&#34; as they sell pizza pretty rapidly so it is fresh,tasty, and hot. For me the infamous clam and garlic lived up to the hype! It was the right amount of garlic to clam ratio. It was quite good and filling. The combination was also delicious with plenty of toppings. I felt two pizza slices were plenty for me. They also have a good selection of beer to wash down that pizza with!  <br><br>The space inside was small but as I said we went for lunch during the week so it was busy but far from packed! With one beer and two slices of pizza my tab was under $ 10.00! Not bad at all for lunch! The service was quick and friendly too. The young lady and guy who was tending to my boss and I were efficient and fun. I would come back since I work in the area and after hours as well.

Tony&#39;s gets a ridiculous amount of publicity, but when you are offering up that many options, it is almost guaranteed that the hype is deserved. <br><br>Knowing that the wait can get upwards of 1-2 hours on the weekends, we decided to head there a bit early on a wednesday night to avoid the crowds. It was a little alarming that they still quoted us a 40 minute wait, but it really turned out to be only around 10 minutes until we were seated.<br><br>Being completely overwhelmed by the plethora of options on the menu we decided to go overboard on our order and get an appetizer and three pizzas for the three of us. Knowing we would have leftovers to take home was comforting and put less pressure to choose the perfect pizza out of the countless choices available.<br><br>-<br><br>Meatball Gigante - As the name implies, this thing was huge. Made of veal, pork and beef the flavor was complex and had a slight kick to it from whatever it was seasoned with. We opted to top it with an egg because why not. The whole thing was tender and juicy with a light tomato sauce covering it all. This was great but I think it would be interesting to try some of the other toppings next time.<br><br>New Yorker - This was the first pizza to come out, and the only one we ordered with red sauce. Since it was coal fired in a 1000 degree oven, the char on the bottom was perfect and crunchy. The sausage was very good as well and you could even see the little fat capsules gleaming in the light. The best parts were where the ricotta chunks were melted on. For my tastes this pizza had a bit too much tomato sauce, but it was good nonetheless. Good as it was, I wouldn&#39;t get it again.<br><br>Stout and sausage - The second pizza to arrive, this was very unique. The menu says that only 23 of these are prepared each day so we were glad to hear that there were still some available. The taste on this was very buttery and sweet, with a light fluffy crust. The caramelized onions really shone through on this pizza and matched well with the mozzarella and fontina cheeses which were gooey throughout, but beautifully browned on top. I was expecting more out of the beer sausage, but the rest of the pizza was so amazing that the sausage filled its purpose in adding some amount of meat to offset the rest. A very good pizza, I would order it again. <br><br>Cal Italia - This was the pizza I chose and it was by far my favorite. A classic italian pizza, this was cooked in a lower temperature oven than the first two, and the crust was noticeably less charred. That was its only drawback though, because everything else about this was amazing. With three different cheeses as its base, prosciutto on top and covered in sweet fig preserve, balsamic reduction and Parmesan shavings, this pizza made my day. It is easy to see why the Food Network awarded it the gold. I will have a hard time not ordering this every time I come here in the future. <br><br>-<br><br>Overall, this was the best pizza place I have tried so far in the city and with a menu so massive, it will take many visits to try all of the options that caught my eye. I especially want to come back and try some of the pizza romana.", "reviewer_name": "Mark O.", "page": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/tonys-pizza-napoletana-san-francisco?osq=pizza"},

Not sure why, i generally never get cravings for it, but none the less, I had a craving and it wasn&#39;t going away. I hopped on yelp and after reading briefly it didn&#39;t seem like a hard choice: Little Star was the place to go for deep dish pizza in San Francisco. <br>To add to my later disappointment, my girlfriend wasn&#39;t at all in the mood for it, but I did one hell of a job convincing her how good it would be so she hopped on board. <br><br>We peeped the menu on-line and ordered the &#39;classic&#39; and &#39;little star&#39; 9&#34; deep dish pizza&#39;s. The garlic bread also got a nice review so we added that to the mix. The nice gentlemen on the phone confirmed my order, gave me my total and informed me that it was cash only. I liked that he did this because I&#39;ve been to multiple places that haven&#39;t and it really sucks when you show up with just a credit card. <br><br>So, parking wasn&#39;t easy but since I knew I&#39;d be quick i blocked the parking structure next door, ran in and grabbed my food. The place was packed and actually looked like it would be a fun place to grab a beer and pizza. My food was ready and they had me out of there in just a minute. So far so good. <br>I get home and I can already taste the food. we open up both boxes, dig in, and I just give my girlfriend a look. She can tell, and she starts laughing(a sympathetic laugh) because she knew how much i was looking forward to this. <br>The pizza certainly wasn&#39;t terrible. It just wasn&#39;t really that good. The crust is very different. I believe its cornmeal which seems to be why some people love it, but not this guy. The peppers and mushrooms on mine weren&#39;t flavorful and the texture was very bad. All in all just not good. <br>My girlfriend was pretty blah with her description as well but I generally don&#39;t like spinach pizza so i didn&#39;t try. The sausage chunks were large which was nice, and tasty, but the pizza just didn&#39;t do anything for me. <br>About 10 minutes after my first bite we realized we ordered the garlic bread and got excited again because we thought that may salvage a little bit of dinner. Well, we opened the bag, found a loaf wrapped in foil with a plastic container that had butter inside. I opened the foil and didn&#39;t smell any garlic. They just gave us bread and f&#39;in butter. At this point I nearly hit myself in the face with a beer bottle. I may have given the place 3 stars initially(since they don&#39;t have 2.5), but not after this. <br>One of the 5 star reviews I read below actually said they consider this better than the deep dish they have in Chicago. I have never been to downtown Chicago, but I&#39;ve been to the outskirts. I&#39;ve also had deep dish all over the northeast and I don&#39;t know what the hell this person is talking about. Generally i consider Pizzeria Uno to be &#39;airport/mall&#39; food, but I guarantee if I lined up the &#39;Chicago classic&#39; from uno against the &#39;classic&#39; from little star, I think people who love little star would fall over from how good the Chicago classic is.

{"reviewe_photo": "https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/kz7pKai_y39gBCV4wO8cNA/60s.jpg", "reviewer_comment": "The addition of Little Star Pizza last fall has made my favorite neighborhood even more enjoyable. I can&#39;t think of a better location for this place. It&#39;s comfortable hip vibe is home to many locals. The familiar background music (all jukebox) , along with the vivid, punchy artwork, set the tone for a light &amp; happy evening with friends.   The lengthy wine, beer and cocktail list aid in creating ample leisure time!\r<br>--THE FOOD: I have never met a pizza I didnt like...but I REALLY enjoy the variety of pies available. The option of thick or thin is just the beginning. The trademark &#34;Little Star&#34; thick crust pizza, is by far their showboat. The ricotta cheese and fresh chunky sauce blanket the pie. Though the cornmeal crust is a unique delicacy, the flavors atop the pie create a meal on their own.  I&#39;m also quite impressed with the vegetarian, and non red-meat options. The thin crust Chicken Pesto is also a favorite of mine. --DESSERT: It is nearly impossible to not gorge myself when visiting LSP, but on the slim chance that I&#39;m still hungry (or feel like splurging) I take full advantage of LSP&#39;s dessert menu. All desserts are made on the premise by a specialized dessert chef. Perhaps the most popular, is the Cheesecake. Words can&#39;t describe how light, fluffy &amp; dream-like it is. I also recommend the gelato. Various flavor are available, depending on the availability each night. It, too, is dreamy and parallels the Italian wonder! --OVERALL: Overall, I&#39;m so very impressed with my local pizza joint. LSP is a place where people know youre name (or learn it quickly). It&#39;s the perfect Sunday  night dinner with friends, or a place to kick off an evening of bars or music.   Once a Divisadero secret, Little Star Pizza has become not only a place of great eats &amp; relaxation, but a warm gathering place for locals.\r<br>p.s. my friend owns the place!  :)", "reviewer_name": "Nicole L.", "page": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/little-star-pizza-divisadero-san-francisco-2?osq=pizza"},

But i&#39;m bored and I yelp when i&#39;m bored so here&#39;s my 2 cents.<br><br>Arizmendi seems to be a sister spinoff of the revered Cheeseboard Collective in Berkeley. I love Cheeseboard and fortunately for me, even after graduation I get to experience something similar to it. Arizmendi offers a different pizza each day and they are all vegetarian. I&#39;ve tried this place many many times and every pizza has been great. Whether it is a triple mushroom pizza with a sesame vinaigrette or a simple heirloom tomato pizza with garlic oil, the ingredients and cheese always work well together.<br><br>I haven&#39;t tried much of the pastries, but I get the cheddar and green onion scones from time to time.. and they are delicious as well.  <br><br>Tiny tiny issues: <br>The place is small so if you have a big group, it&#39;ll be better to take the pizza to go and enjoy it elsewhere.. The park is so close by so that shouldn&#39;t be a big problem! Lines can get very very lone around 12- 12:30. Therefore I feel the best time to come here is sometime around 11:30 because not will the line be fairly short, but they don&#39;t bring the pizzas out until around 11:30. This means they&#39;ll be fresh and hot.<br><br>Also, it&#39;s cash only but this shouldn&#39;t be a big deal, esp if you have BOA since there&#39;s one down the street.

Dang this place is good, beyond good. It&#39;s been on my wish list forever. After 3 attempts of more than 2hr long waits, I came in at 12pm on a weekday right when they open and got my table in 15 minutes. Apart from being on the Michelin guide, Tony&#39;s Pizza had won the World Pizza Cup, gold medal winner las vegas 2014, gold medal winner food network pizza champions challenge, gold cup winner international pizza championships, and much more. Many of the pizzas have limited servings per day due to the precious imports of Neapolitan and Italian ingredients. They offer several styles of pizzas which include Neapolitan, Classic American and Italian, Sicilian, Pizza Romana, Gluten Free and New York, Detroit and St. Louis Style. We finally settled on 2 of the award winning ones - MARGHERITA and CAL ITALIA. <br><br>MARGHERITA 12&#34; (world pizza cup winner naples, italy 2007) is Napoletana Style - 900 Degree Wood Fired pizza, limited 73 per day. Dough finished by hand using caputo red flour then proofed in napoletana wood boxes, san marzano tomatoes D.O.P., sea salt, mozzarella fior di latte, fresh basil, extra virgin olive oil. The pizza had a thin and soft bottom crust, slightly wet middle, chewy and doughy outer crust. It was pretty small, around 10 inches. This was my absolute favorite pizza!! It is quite pricey at $21 for such a small size, but it is SO GOOD. the mozzarella balls are melted perfectly, chewy yet not too rich nor salty, and the crust is just beyond this world. <br><br>CAL ITALIA 12&#34; (gold medal winner food network pizza champions challenge) is Classic Italian Style - 650 Degree Gas or 700 Degree Electric. The pizza was a hand tossed rustic medium crust with asiago, mozzarella, italian gorgonzola, croatian sweet fig preserve, prosciutto di parma, parmigiano, balsamic reduction, no sauce. It was slightly bigger than Napoletana Margherita, around 12 inches, priced at $23. The crust was thin and crispy at the bottom(you can hold it up parallel to the plate), and had a crispy outer crust. I loved the sweet fig preserve and honey that gives the pizza its sweetness, and asiago cheese and prosciutto for its saltiness. It was slightly too salty for me and the asiago cheese was a bit too rich after a while. However, great pizza.<br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Second visit, tried something different. <br><br>LITTLE ITALY salad - mixed greens, chopped castelveltrano olives,walnuts, imported italian gorgonzola, olive oil, balsamic reduction, cherry tomatoes, shaved parmigiano. Huge portion, very very delicious. Loved the dressing &amp; cheese combo!<br><br>NEW YORKER 16&#34; (gold medal winner las vegas 2013) is Coal Fired Style - 1000 Degree. Serves 2-4. Mozzarella, hand crushed tomato sauce, natural casing pepperoni, sliced italian fennel sausage, calabrese sausage, ricotta, chopped garlic &amp; oregano. This one is about twice the size as Margherita or Cal Italia, and you definitely get your money worth. LOVED the ricotta and mozzarella on tomato pizza. The meat combo was a bit too heavy, but very delicious nonetheless. Order this if you&#39;re hungry and want something good and hearty.<br><br>Favorites:<br>* MARGHERITA ($21)<br>* NEW YORKER ($29)<br>* LITTLE ITALY salad ($12)<br><br>Others:<br>* CAL ITALIA ($23)", "reviewer_name": "Victoria L.", "page": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/tonys-pizza-napoletana-san-francisco?osq=pizza"},

If you come during or a little after the dinner rush there WILL be a wait! And parking is horrendous. Not sure about parking as we are not from here but we ended up at the top of a steep hill to have to walk all the way down to the pizzeria.<br>The restaurant is on the corner and has outdoor seating as well. We sat in the bar area which was cozy, and intimate. We were not immediately greeted and once our waiter did come his personality although I&#39;m sure hes a very nice man was just bland and not attentive. He did offer his opinion on the pizza he enjoys but that&#39;s where it stopped. Never once were we asked if refills were needed we always had to ask. My boyfriend literally tried to flag him down three times at one point and then literally had to yell excuse me to get a beer ordered. And mind you this was right before the dinner rush and or leading into the rush...<br>I even had to ask for plates and silverware when our salad was brought to us with a spoon to serve everyone at the table but no plate or silverware to eat it with.<br>The food is what is the real winner here! We started with meatballs as an appetizer. So yum! Tasted homemade and were just the right size. Cesar salad was next which was okay. I feel their dressing could be better. We chose the New Yorker pizza (one of their award winning) with pepperoni, sausage, ricotta cheese and mozzarella. Star of the show!

I will tell you, I was shocked out how good this pizza was. The first thing you taste is garlic, then you bite into the perfected texture of the crust, and pieces of clam in each bite.

The calamari is a huge portion (as it should be for $17) and was good. The Caesar was stand out. <br>We went for Cal Italia, the Bianco Tonno and the Some Like it Hot. The Cal Italia was really good, mild and a little sweet. The Some Like it Hot was okay, not my personal cup of tea and super spicy, but the crust was delightful. Tonno.... oh my god. Amazing. I could eat five to myself. Seriously. Oh my god. <br>Desserts left room for improvement. We ordered one cannoli (looked OK) and two gelatos (OK). Probably not worth the money as there are some really good cafes and bakeries in the area. <br>Service was really attentive and friendly, with recommendations happily given and constant water service. The hostess in charge of reservations was a little sharp, but I guess they&#39;re super busy so it&#39;s understandable.", "reviewer_name": "Poppy C.", "page": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/tonys-pizza-napoletana-san-francisco?osq=pizza"},

We actually drove by 3 times looking for parking and were still unable to locate where little star was. That was until I actually spotted a &#34;little star&#34; and I got a little peek inside the restaurant. Place seemed a bit like those shady night clubs where they open a little slit and ask you for a password before you come in. Just my opinion. <br><br>We found parking a lot easier than we were anticipating which was good because SF street parking could be a little B. We got in, the restaurant seemed to be lit only by natural sunlight haha. Not super crowded on a Thursday evening. We were promptly seated and then ordered of course the deep dish pizza and an order of spicy chicken wings. The deep dish was a bit disappointing...I guess that&#39;s what happens when things are hyped up. I was expecting some sort of fiesta in my mouth but it never came. The chicken wings were actually pretty good. Pizza on the otherhand, could have been better. I think the sauce was a bit too tart for my taste and needed more of a marinara zing to it. The pie itself did look very appetizing. Maybe a different combination would have made a difference? Prices aren&#39;t to die for either. Pretty reasonable.

That&#39;s right, I said it, and you should have known this already. Golden Boy is my favorite so far but after trying Little Star it&#39;s going to be my local favorite (the schlop on Lower Haight is only good for drunk eating).<br><br>Ambiance (4): Standard issue hipster-ish interior with low lights, mixture of wood and metal, and some art on the wall. Not complaining, it&#39;s good to go, just not what I expect of a pizza joint. <br><br>Food (4): They are known for their deep dish but after going to Chicago a few times, I have sworn off deep dish pizza. It&#39;s just too much...too much! We had a thin crust with pancetta, goat cheese, chicken, and I don&#39;t remember what else (it had me at pancetta). It was pretty tasty and the crust was good and crisp. We ordered the smaller size since we were having wings too and it was just the right size. The chicken wings were not bad, but I haven&#39;t had a chicken wing that doesn&#39;t remind me of microwaveable buffalo wings since Sports Grill (new English rule: double negative bad, triple negative good). This might be related to the wings not being grilled, which is my preferred wing preparation method. In terms of drinks, I appreciate that they have tempranillo and malbec in stock in addition to the usual suspects, so if you like red wine, they are bound to have something that appeals to your tastes. Of course they have beer and white wine too. Also the 10 dollar corkage fee is appreciated.<br><br>Service (4): Great, friendly service. The timing of the dishes arriving was perfect and I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s coincidence or the server putting in the order in a certain way or us eating at just the right rate. Anyway, I felt welcomed and being taken care of without the incessant and forced niceties of some fancy restaurants (I am looking at you Gary Danko). There always seems to be a wait to get a table though, but what can you do when the place has good foodie cred?<br><br>Value (4): The prices of all menu items seemed just right. That includes the cost of drinks and I already mentioned the corkage fee.<br><br>Overall: I liked this place but did not love it like I do Golden Boy. The quality is good and the flavors were good but just not amazing. However, this the best option in my area, so next time take out will be the way to go to avoid the wait. Oh and if you have a deep dish craving, this is one of the few places in the city that I have spotted it so far.", "reviewer_name": "Alvaro H.", "page": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/little-star-pizza-divisadero-san-francisco-2?osq=pizza"},

But oh my $%%^&amp;*(lgjvsdsd[ae. Sorry my tongue fell on my keyboard. Was it worth the wait! We ordered one large special which i believe was meat balls, spinach, peppers and cheese, as well as chicken pesto. They were equally delicious! What makes Little Star different from the &#34;other guys&#34; is their rich and almost maybe home made tomato sauce, as well as their pie crust!

We came here for my friend&#39;s birthday dinner on Memorial Day as several people said the pizza is great. I will start by saying the pizza is very good, which is why I still gave two stars instead of one. However, the night was very much hurt by the horrible service. <br><br>Tony&#39;s does not take reservations, so they say to be prepared to wait 1.5-2 hours for dinner. We put our name down for 5 people and went to Joe&#39;s across the street for a glass of wine. We were told it&#39;d likely be about a 1.5 hour wait. We were texted only about 45 minutes later saying our table was ready and that our entire party needed to be present at the hostess stand within 5 minutes or they would give away our table. We rushed to pay our bill at Joe&#39;s and also frantically called our 5th friend to hurry over because she had been expecting to not have to be there until at least 30 minutes later. Once we arrived, the hostess forgot we had 5 people and not just 4 and asked us to wait a bit. We waited an ADDITIONAL 50 minutes!!! Don&#39;t force us to rush over from across the street saying our table is ready only to force us to wait almost another hour sitting in the squished area next to the hostess stand. <br><br>Finally, we are getting seated and I mention to the women that it is my friend&#39;s birthday. I ask if they can bring out a dessert for her. The woman says yes and asks if tiramisu is okay. She even makes sure to confirm which one of my friends is the birthday girl. She says she will let the waiter know. Once seated, we wait for at least 15 minutes, and no waiter comes by (not even to get us water.) By now it is past 9pm (they stop guaranteeing tables at that time even if you&#39;re on the wait list as the restaurant closed at 10.) We are hungry and inpatient. <br><br>The menu can be pretty overwhelming because there are a TON of options. And for the average person, it&#39;s kind of hard to really know the difference between Detroit, New York, Sicilian, California, Grandma, and Classic Italian. We wanted help from our waiter, and we&#39;re pretty sure he was high. He was speaking so quietly and didn&#39;t seem to have much energy to help us make a decision. We ended up getting the prosciutto coccoli to start, the Cal Italia pizza, the New Yorker pizza, and a carafe of red sangria to share. The food is good however a lot of their pizzas are very saucy and me along with another of my friends don&#39;t actually like tomato sauce that much. So that was more unfortunate for us, but others did like it. The Cal Italia doesn&#39;t have tomato sauce, but I didn&#39;t really like the sticky fig preserve. <br><br>The final straw however came with us being done with our food and waiting 20 more minutes. No one came by to offer a dessert menu or to pack up our leftovers or even to bring the check. The restaurant was essentially closed, and we were one of the last tables in the restaurant. Finally, I went up to our waiter to ask where our tiramisu was and to get the check. He looked at me with a blank stare and said the woman never told him about a birthday or a dessert. HELLLO ARE YOU KIDDING. Then he says needs to go and check to make sure they can still bring the dessert because the kitchen has already closed... Thankfully, they did end up bringing it out but it wasn&#39;t the best quality (kind of melted). Also, he even still charged us $8 for the dessert....<br><br>I will not be coming back unless I happen to have 3.5 hours to waste while people stop by to serve me when they feel like it...

It was here at Ye Olde Neighborhood Organic Baked Goods Cooperative that I first outed myself as a lover of the oat scone and learned that I was in good company. In truth, oat scones don&#39;t sound particularly enticing, but these little puckshaped cakes are crispy on the outside, yet surprisingly moist inside. How you can do that with something made of about 75% oats baffles my mind. So the oat scones are my first choice at Arizmendi.<br>Second choice is the Scone Of the Day, huge and fluffy with crunchy sugar on the outside and yummy fruit like apples, berries or apricots on the inside.<br>Third choice is the occasional cheese roll, chocolate thing, bran muffin, corn cherry scone, banana walnut muffin, pecan roll, brioche roll, or any type of cookie. Or whatever else. I&#39;ll eat it and like it.<br>Maybe pick up a challah, pizza, container of olives, some jam or honey, a dip or two...so yeah, I&#39;d do all my shopping here if I could afford it, and if I found carbo loading to actually be helpful for running and not just an excuse to eat stuff that tastes good. <br>Even though The Beanery is down the street with loads of good coffee to be had, I like the coffee at Arizmendi too, and there&#39;s that dude who always thanks me for bringing in my humongazoid commuter mug and gives me  like ten cents off.

I&#39;m not going to put myself on record that Pizza Hut is quality pizza, but there is admittedly something about that dough...).

It&#39;s a bakery with bread and sweet stuff. How could it not be good? But it&#39;s not just good, it&#39;s f&#39;n great!  I LOVE arizmendi cheese scones. If I meet a man that I enjoy this much, I will do anything for him.  Seriously.  I live 4.5 miles away. I walk 9 miles round trip just to have 5 minutes with the cheese scone. I have yet to meet a man for whom I would do anything close to that.  I have loved the cheese rolls in the past, but not so much recently. They seem to depend on the baker, and my last few visits they were too hard, actually hurt my jaw eating them. And too small. And not enough cheese! <br>But the Olive-provolone bread? oh YEAH! And the chocolate things? Yep. Yumma yumma. I love bread. I love sugar. I love bread and sugar. And cheese. They have it all.<br>The pizza does not appeal to me. I like traditional pizza, not fancy topping stuff without tomato sauce. But they occasionally have something called &#34;lunch lady&#34; pizza in the focaccia case that I like. It&#39;s mostly bread with some tomato sauce and cheese. My kinda pizza. Mmm mmm. <br>Ah Arizmendi, I love thee. <br>I just tried the new one on Valencia last week (on a cheese scone day, of course. I looked it up to make sure). It&#39;s a nice space, but the counter person was not nice.  She was not pleasant at all. And while taking my money she started talking with her coworker and reading something. She was about to close register without giving me my change, and when I said something, she gave me the nastiest shit-eating look. WTF? <br>Well, that&#39;s hipster Valencia for you.  The cheese scone was not as good there, either. It was...different. Maybe the baker fell of his/her fixie that day? I dunno.

Given the size of my party I was lucky--I got to sample 5 different styles of pizza and 6 pies so I can say and I had a great sample of the menu.<br><br>Pizzas I sampled:<br><br>First two pizzas::<br>Margherita - very light and fresh tasting. The wood fired taste was definitely present I liked it a lot but I prefer meat on my pizzas! However this was a high quality pizza.<br><br>Third pizza:<br> New Yorker - This was my second favorite pizza, I loved the sausage and pepperoni; however, what really sets this pizza apart is the ricotta cheese--it adds a dimension to the pizza that I have never tasted before.  If you like NY style pizza this is a must try.<br><br>Fourth Pizza:<br>La Regina - This pizza was amazing!!! I have never tasted anything like this combination before.  Granted, if I had not been with a group I would have never tried this pizza as I am a pepperoni and sausage guy.  However, I must say this pizza just did everything well - a great balance of the bread, cheese, sauce, and toppings with the contrast of cheeses.  Also, if you are in a group the Sicilian pizzas are best because they are a little thicker and will help to fill up the party.  Also, the size of the Sicilians are larger than the other pizzas (except the 22inches which are the largest) so you will get more pizza for your buck.  Next time, I will try the Fratellanza to see how it compares!<br><br>Fifth Pizza:<br>Tartufo - This was my first time trying a truffle pizza and I must say it was good. I was not sure of what the hype was about truffles but now I get it.  This was definitely a rich pizza with a great flavor profile and its texture was light and thin like the Magherita crust.<br><br>Sixth Pizza:<br>New Haven Lou - I never would have ordered this (or any pizza other than the New Yorker on my own!) which is why I am glad I came with a large group.  A friend in the group was vegetarian and I must say as the last 2 slices I had (I had quite a few slices!) this was a very light, healthy and refreshing/ palate cleansing pizza.<br><br>My personal favorite: La Regina (1); New Yorker (2); Tarfuto (3); Magherita (4); New Haven Lou (5).  This takes nothing away from any pizza (I am a meat lover).<br><br>The most important point for me to highlight about Tony&#39;s is that each of these pizzas had a totally different flavor profile so each slice I tried was a totally new and amazing pizza experience.<br><br>Finally, none of the pizzas I had were &#34;greasy&#34; as you typically get at a pizza shop--definitely the highest quality pizza I have ever had.<br><br>Lastly, the staff was amazing very friendly and helpful in working with our large party!!<br><br> I will be returning.", "reviewer_name": "Corey H.", "page": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/tonys-pizza-napoletana-san-francisco?osq=pizza"},

I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the meat, probably because it was veal, pork, and beef, but i&#39;m also not a huge meat lover. If someone who loves meat were to come to Tony&#39;s, I would recommend it. For me personally, 3/5.<br>Margerita pizza: they only serve 73 a day, so you can only get it if you come early. It was amazing. Perfect. Very Italian. LOVE. 5/5<br>Pasta Genovese: Pesto pasta which I loved. Pesto was not quite as good as it was in cinque terre in Italy, but it was still really good. I don&#39;t think the pasta is made in house at Tony&#39;s, at least it didn&#39;t taste like it. 4/5<br>Pasta with Pink Sauce: or vodka sauce or something.

When we brought this issue up to the female cashier, she questioned the male worker if he gave two slices of our whole pizza away. The guy lied and stated he did not. The cashier stated if there&#39;s eight pieces in the bags then there&#39;s no missing slices. We checked all the slices before eating and found out that four of the slices were half a size of a regular slice.

So when my husband found this place, I was ecstatic! Since then, the only pizza I ever crave is a Golden Boy slice! <br><br>On our first visit we ordered a slice of cheese, pepperoni, veggie and the garlic clam. I am always on the lookout for that perfect cheese and pepperoni pizza. I feel like some places over cook the pepperoni, there is too much cheese and not enough sauce etc. This place however, has gotten it down!!! It was the right amount of cheese, the pepperoni isn&#39;t over cooked, it&#39;s till soft and I love how each of the slice had the right amount of cheese and sauce ratio! (a big deal in my book) <br><br>Veggie slice- Your typical veggie pizza.

Last weekend though, we were in the area just as they opened so we made it into the line and got a seat at the bar (because the rest of the tables filled up. literally. Within 10 minutes of them opening. I&#39;m not kidding when I say this place can be nuts).<br><br>We ordered two cocktails and a side of deep fried green beans to start with. There was actually a *lot* of green beans, we couldn&#39;t finish them all (at least without leaving room for pizza which, let&#39;s face it, is the only reason to go here). <br><br>Our pizza came out pretty quick and it looked amazeballs. Like, awesome liquidy sauce, dripping cheese, chunks of basil. I couldn&#39;t wait to grab it.<br><br>This isn&#39;t really &#34;slice&#34; pizza, expect to eat it with a fork, but who cares when it comes to pizza this good. We made quick work of the entire pie without feeling like we&#39;d overeaten. <br><br>The cheese could be a *slightly* bit better if they went with a buffalo mozzarella instead of just regular. Don&#39;t get me wrong, the cheese is great and amazing quality, but there was just a small bit of *oomph* that I felt was missing, that made other pizzas I&#39;ve had just a bit more memorable than this one.<br><br>That being said, if you find yourself in the area and either it&#39;s early enough or the line isn&#39;t there, check this place out.

We were both leaving Beretta and they were not impressed with Beretta&#39;s pizza at all, so we had to try Tony&#39;s since we like Beretta a lot. She especially recommended the coccoli, which is basically fried dough with cheese and meat. It&#39;s very good, but we preferred the meatballs and pizza.The meatball gigante is amazing. We ordered the one with the egg and calabrese. It comes with a delicious spicy arrabbiata-like sauce that we also dipped the coccoli in. <br><br>Since then, my friends and I have been trying different pizzas each time to see which we like the best. They&#39;ve all been good, but some are way better than others. The menu is so huge and they all sound good, so we will get through it all eventually, lol. The longstanding favorite is the prosciutto e pomodorini with arugula, cherry tomatoes, mozzarella, prosciutto, and amazing parmigiano. The crust on this one is perfect too. <br><br>Their pride and joy seems to be the margherita, and while it was good, it was kind of hard to eat because it was so flimsy and it was good, but nothing to write home about. My cousin, bf, and I were just meh about it, even though we wanted to love it.<br><br> The sausage and stout pizza was a little too sweet for a pizza and we didn&#39;t love all of the flavors together, but this one has the best crust of all of them we&#39;ve tried thus far. It has a delicious flavor with a hint of stout. I wish we could order this crust with other toppings. <br><br>As much as we wanted to love the tartufo, ours came undercooked and a little soggy, and the flavors were just okay. The wild mushrooms kind of overpowered the flavors of the truffle, prosciutto, etc. We took it home and cooked it more and while that made it better, the crust still wasn&#39;t a favorite by far.<br><br>The Barcelona sounded amazing, but was just okay. Maybe we just don&#39;t love breakfast pizza (although in theory it sounds amazing)? It had manchego cheese, jamon, egg, etc. <br><br>The New Yorker is our second favorite, although you should only order this one alone if you go, or order it and eat it last since it&#39;s so rich that it will overpower anything you eat after it, or fill you up too much. We were served this one before a less in your face one and that messed up our palates for sure (I couldnt say that less douche-y without getting my point across, but it&#39;s true) It&#39;s very saucy, with mozzarella, dollops of ricotta, sausage, and pepperoni, etc. The crust was so good since it was coal fired too. It&#39;s a huge pizza and is so rich, but highly recommended. <br><br>Please go to this place! I would recommend the prosciutto e pomodorini to start with if it&#39;s your first time.

This was a great slice of pie.<br><br>I finished the night having consumed 6 slices (4 DD&#39;s, 2 thin) and a pint of pilsner.  Although I was able to walk it off throughout the course of the night..

Her brother lives down the road from the restaurant and eats there often. To save us from having to wait for hours, he went by the restaurant a couple hours before we were supposed to arrive and put our names on the list. I would highly recommend doing this as they send you a text when your table is ready. <br><br>We shared several different appetizers and one pizza. Some of the dishes were amazing and some were only so-so.<br><br>Little Italy Salad - This was the best dish that we ordered! While that statement my sound like an insult to the rest of the food, it really isn&#39;t. This salad was just really that good. The melange of flavors and textures was superb. The slight bitterness of the salad greens was balanced by the sweetness of the crunchy walnuts, the saltiness of the chopped olives, and the earthiness of the gorgonzola cheese. I would highly recommend starting your meal with this salad.<br><br>Coccoli (sea-salted fried dough) with prosciutto and burrata - If you love the fried dough you get at carnivals, you must try this dish. Each bite of the pillow-soft, savory fried dough with a little bit of creamy burrata spread on top of it and a slice of salty prosciutto on top was packed with flavor. My fiance wasn&#39;t crazy about this dish, but the rest of us enjoyed it.<br><br>Deep Fried Green Beans - If you are looking for a good vegetable side dish to go with your pizza, this is a good option. They were slightly crunchy and not too oily.<br><br>Garlic Bread with Cheese - Much to my dismay, the cheesy bread was topped with entire cloves of roasted garlic. I like a little bit of garlic, but an entire clove is too much for my taste.<br><br>Gluten Free Breadsticks - This was the only appetizer out of the five we tried that I would not recommend (even if you are gluten free). The breadsticks were basically flat, soft crackers without any flavor. <br><br>Coal-Fired New Yorker pizza - My fiance&#39;s brother orders this pizza every time he goes to Tony&#39;s. The crust is incredible. It is thin, crisp, and has the nice bits of char from the coal-fired oven. The toppings of the pizza looked incredible on the menu, but were kind of disappointing in reality. The tomato sauce was sweeter than I would have liked it to be. The sweetness of the sauce was then exacerbated by the slight sweetness of the dollops of creamy ricotta cheese. The sweetness of these two ingredients completely overpowered the other toppings. While I would definitely recommend ordering a coal-fired pizza, I would avoid the New Yorker unless you like sweet pizzas. <br><br>I think that the quantity limits on certain pizzas and drinks (&#34;limit of 23 per day!&#34;) is a little gimmicky, and that listing the awards that certain pizzas have won is extremely tacky (i.e. &#34;Gold medal winner Las Vegas 2013&#34;; Really?).

Also, because I&#39;m from New York, I have a very particular notion of what makes for a good chicken wing - and that is deep fried wings slathered in a sauce of butter and Frank&#39;s Red Hot. The Little Star wings were tasty, but not what I look for in a wing. We sat in the back and it was a lot darker than the pictures suggest. Our table was kind of tipsy, but after a few glasses of Racer 5, so were we, so it didn&#39;t matter. Our server was friendly, but not particularly attentive. By around 9:00, the place filled up with people hanging out around the bar and generally being more casual than us, which I think is the way to go at Little Star.\r<br>\r<br>Update: Went again last night.

Typically, by-the-slice pizza joints around town are utilitarian at best, with little to no thought being put into taste or ingredients. The only goal is to feed the zombie apocalypse of drunken twenty-somethings before complete anarchy ensues, but here, things are different.

We were seated outside by the slice house. This was a Sunday night and it was pretty busy. Only one waitress was working, which was unfortunate. We waited 15 minutes for our waitress to come out. We put our drink orders in and ordered bread and meatballs, which came out before the drinks. Bread was served with balsamic glaze rather than balsamic vinagerette (strange). We sat for another 20 minutes waiting to put our actual order in, and it turns out they were out of the Honey Pie. This was very discouraging, so we asked for a few more minutes to look for something else. Another 15 minutes go by with no waitress in sight. We flag down the hostess who was walking by from the slice house, and we ask for our check. I tell her about our slow service, and she doesn&#39;t seem to care. She comes back a few minutes later and slaps the bill on the table and walks off. We pay $30 for two diet cokes, meatballs, and bread. Bit disappointed that there wasn&#39;t an apology for the slow servive. At this point, our alternative options for dining have largely closed in the area, and my GF is starting to get upset.

However, I am compelled to give the flagship establishment only 3 stars because of the ridiculous wait times and absolutely dreadful service from the management.

We then walked across the street to the bar area of another establishment to enjoy a drink or two while we waited. But to our dismay and increasing hunger, it wasn&#39;t until shortly before 9PM that our table became available. And to add to insult to injury, they seated us outside under a malfunctioning heat-lamp (of which they were well aware).

It&#39;s not unusual, but it&#39;s more like a concept maximizing surface space to eat. Late business hours makes this place the best hang out spot after a long night drinking or dancing.<br><br>Cheap prices, friendly customer service, and tasty selections always win repeat customers whether you dine-in or take-out. A group of us strolled up to Golden Boy Pizza after having a few drinks at La Trappe and the line was pretty short at 12:15am. By 12:30am, the line was 20 people deep but it flowed fast. At first, I didn&#39;t want any pizza, but by the time I stood in the doorway, I smelled the pizza fragrance blowing from the heavy duty fan above and couldn&#39;t resist. My friend ordered four slices of combo and he topped it off with oregano and chili. I grabbed the massive slice and was able to control it by positioning every fingertip on each of the four corners. Cheese was oozing off, toppings were huge, and flavor hit the spot.<br><br>POW! Off the hook! <br><br>This has got to be a marvel of the world. With each bite, more cheese oozed off, and I kept trying to balance the tomatoes and sausages from falling off the top. Generous topping of zucchini, pepperoni, mushrooms, and sausage were infused in the mozzarella. I had to pick out most onions, but ate some by accident. Advice: You really just can&#39;t use one napkin and you need a drink or soda to wash everything down.<br><br>I was definitely satisfied. If I didn&#39;t have as much beer and alcohol in my body as I did; I would&#39;ve inhaled another piece.

They have 6 options: cheese, pepperoni, clam, pesto vegetarian, vegetables and sausage. And it&#39;s cheap. Period. <br><br>After yoga and some grocery shopping this evening, the thought of cooking dinner was unbearable. I walk past Golden Boy and think &#34;Why not? Cheap and easy&#34;. I walk in. The place, like many reviewers already mentioned, is a hole in the wall. I remember eating in just once, when I had just moved to SF, and never again feeling tempted to repeat it. I was reminded today the reason why - the service just sucks! That just kills it for me!<br><br>I order my pizza, the guy barely acknowledges me, as he is in a conversation with another customer about why his alter-ego is &#39;mayor Giuliani&#34;. He warms up my pizza, asks me if it&#39;s &#39;to go&#39;, then when he takes it out of the oven, he asks me if I want him to wrap it up. What I am supposed to say?!?!?! It&#39;s TO GO!!! OF COURSE!!! Argh!!! <br><br>I wrap it up, regretting stopping by to buy it, and having a total deja-vu - service ALWAYS sucked when I went there before and that&#39;s why I never came back!  But it gets worse - after taking a nice shower, putting some nice Billie Holliday on, and getting ready to eat my pizza with a nice glass of wine, I take the first bite, and realize that the crust was burned! No, seriously! He warmed it up too long! Way to go!<br><br>Maybe I need to party hard one night and go face the long lines late at night (and with the munchies)  to  be able to appreciate this place.

We asked about the other pizza, and were treated poorly- &#34;this one only takes 90 seconds&#34; and still no wine.  We were told they were looking for it! And the waiter had to climb over some boxes to try to find it. One in our group offered to help find it. No, we&#39;ll find it....<br>And we wait. Finally a different wine than the first and backup showed up- after we had finished the first pizza.<br>And we waited.  <br>After another 15 min we saw the manager talking to another table and asked to see him. He came over, we asked about the other pizza. He did not apologize at all!  He said that there were many orders and he couldn&#39;t remember them all (???? )  Then he walked away from the table, saying he would check.<br>And we waited. <br>Finally we decided to skip the second pizza which still had not appeared, pay and leave.

Strange enough, the organization is categorized by the oven temperature they are cooked at. Aside from the temperature, there is no description on the pizza.

I even went on a Neapolitan pizza hunt in Manhattan and this beats anything I tried in NY for traditional pies. <br>They use high quality buffalo mozzarella, the tomato sauce is light and slightly sweet, and the crust is classic: with a nice light char and kinda soft in the middle of the pie. I think some people do not realize that original Neapolitan pizza has a crust that is soft in the middle and cannot be folded to eat as easily as other pizzas. In my opinion, this is the only kind of pizza that could ever be eaten with a fork because of that soft crust middle... not that I ever use anything but my hands.

I came in on a weekday afternoon on new year&#39;s eve and there were plenty of places to sit.<br><br>Atmosphere: Pretty limited seating here with all bar-type seating (probably ~20-25 overall?). Definitely a hipster/indy feel to with random stickers and writing all over the place (including the bathroom mirrors). <br><br>Food: It looked like you can only get what they have out, which isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing since all the pizzas looked great! they&#39;re decent-sized square slices of thin crust pizza with awesome combinations of sauce/toppings (the kind I would normally have to special order). It was really solid pizza, but nothing extraordinary or unique in my opinion. They have a pretty good draught beer selection too! Lots of local stuff which is always a plus ($5 for a pint).<br><br>Service: The cashier/bartender was extremely nice and patient with us when we were deciding. Pizza only took less than 5 minutes.<br><br>Value: Eh, I would say it&#39;s slightly overpriced for what you get. I get that it&#39;s SF, but given their popularity I think they could afford to make it slightly cheaper per slice. Just my opinion though, definitely not crazy overpriced though so don&#39;t get me wrong!<br><br>Overall: This definitely hit the spot for my pizza craving and I dug the combinations of toppings. The service was great too! I try to save my 5-stars for places that are super unique and knock me down with awesomeness.

After going up and down slopes &amp; circling around for a good 10 minutes, I  finally found parking &amp; got to the restaurant by 10:30pm. <br><br>I wasn&#39;t really hungry, but wanted to give this place a shot and see if they were all that amazing. As I pedaled to the store, the front glass window had a very tempting display of all the Sicilian style pan pizza. To my surprise, I had this sudden  urge of hunger/cravings. I guess visual displays does work its own charm<br><br>I quickly placed my order on the garlic clam as I only saw 3 slices left. This was the highly reviewed/raved  topping and I would&#39;ve been totally bummed if I wasn&#39;t able to give this a try. Although the garlic clam was the only one I had in mind, I couldn&#39;t resist ordering another slice of the combination. The friendly waitress scooped up the two slice and tossed it back to the oven for a quick bake for crispness. <br><br>The pizza came out perfect. IT was warm and the crust was very crispy. The cheese was nice and all toppings were bubbling with the fresh out of oven look. I immediately dug my fork/knife into the slice of heavenly goodness. First thought in mind was..&#34;wow this is quite garlicky&#34;.  The greatest difference I felt about the Sicilian styled pizza vs typical american pizza chain store were that the crust is thick/crispy but not greasy at all. The tomato spread is rather light and does not carry that strong tomato paste taste. The layer of cheese was thin and isn&#39;t loaded with the typical chewy/stretchiness. Toppings were very generous as mine was just smothered with garlic/herbs and a hint of clam. I&#39;m honestly a chicago style pizza fan and loves anything with thick buttery crust and loads of cheese. I would say that I still steer towards BJs&#39; chicago style pizza and Pizza Huts Pan pizza. If not then I love the classic Italian at &#34;Bollinis&#34; over in LA. <br><br>However, this was overall a good slice of pizza that would definitely be satisfying when you crave that hot fresh pizza with a thick/crispy crust. Service was fast. Pizza would be ready in 5 minutes and an order of beer would be paired pefectly for a late hang out with friends. Place is very cramp but with a fair amount of seat. It was rather pricey for a small rectangular slice at $3.75 but would be well worth it when you&#39;re craving some good pizza on the go.", "reviewer_name": "Susan T.", "page": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/golden-boy-pizza-san-francisco?osq=pizza"},

Every time I tried, there was at least an hour wait. Yesterday being Valentine&#39;s Day, I thought that I just had to do it, no matter the wait time. Unluckily for me, everyone else had the same idea. I ended up waiting two hours for a table for two. During that time I did have the chance to discover a really great wine bar nearby (stay tuned). <br><br>Once we finally got the table, I enjoyed every minute of my Tony&#39;s experience! We were seated outside, we had a friendly server and the food was great. To drink, we ordered a bottle of California white wine (by the way, Tony&#39;s is famous for their extensive wine list). Make sure you ask them to keep the wine chilled for you, if that&#39;s what you prefer.<br><br> As a starter, we had the kale salad - amazing - with beets, walnuts, and feta cheese. As a main we had the Pauline P pizza, which we decided to share. The pizza was delicious, and more than enough for two people. <br><br>Once we were done, no one rushed us to leave. The staff took their time clearing the table and bringing the check, which I really appreciated. Being such a busy restaurant you would expect them to rush you out the door as soon as you&#39;re finished, but not at Tony&#39;s. <br><br>Overall, worth the wait, I would do it again in a heart beat!", "reviewer_name": "Aletta B.", "page": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/tonys-pizza-napoletana-san-francisco?osq=pizza"},

I came here after going to the Cal Academy of Sciences in Golden Gate Park.  Yes the parking is little funky and yes it&#39;s kinda a hole in the wall.  But the place is jammin with locals (of which I&#39;m not, I came from the East Bay).<br><br>We had a cool server who refilled our water. The beer comes in bigger than normal pints. I think they are like 20oz.  And we got a great deal on the happy hour or early bird special.  <br><br>So onto the pizza. <br>Deep Dish.  This deep dish I can really only compare to Zacharys.  I like Little Stars tomato sauce. It&#39;s not as vinegary.  The dough is not as crunchy/crusty as Zachary&#39;s but I thought it was good. The amount of stuffing was okay. Not over generous, but not skimpy.  Fair, but I would have preferred more.<br><br>We also got a chicken/pesto thin crust pizza.  This was okay.  It&#39;s not super greasy like a  thin new york pizza which I liked, but the downer was that the chicken was extremely dry.  Add that to a drier crust and it was not something you want to come back and order again.  Had I known the crush was more on the dry end, I would have said order a more &#34;oilier&#34; topping like sausage or more veggies.<br><br>Anyways--- the pizza was decent-- I wouldn&#39;t call it my favorite but I wouldn&#39;t tell you to avoid this place.  But the atmosphere and the service and personnel were fun so give it a try and try different pizzas. I&#39;m sure if I do, I&#39;ll find something I like. <br><br>We also got a salad. The dressing was perfectly ratioed to the greens.  But I would have preferred less onions.<br><br>Oh !

We decided to have a drink at the bar while we waited, and the wait wound up being about 15 minutes, not bad at all considering what everyone else on Yelp was saying about ridiculous wait lines. <br><br>Their pizza was super good. My review is as follows: <br><br>Sausage and Stout: By far my favorite. Loved the sauce, loved the crust which just melts in your mouth. The sausage was good too, my only wish was that they added more! Or maybe ground it up and spread it evenly. We got about one slice of sausage per slice of pizza, and that one bite would be amazing, but then you went sausage-less for the rest of the slice. The caramelized onions and scallions were amazing on it too. <br><br>Meatball Gigante: Oh man I could eat about a dozen of these and be so happy. About the size of a small grapefruit, this baby was packed with flavor and gave you a little bit of a kick. Cooked to perfection, the marinara sauce was amazing. Order it with the egg, and it will be one of the best things you&#39;ve ever eaten. <br><br>New Yorker: With sausage and huge chunks of creamy ricotta cheese, what can go wrong? This was an amazing pizza, and I don&#39;t even like thin crust pizza. Not as good as the sausage and stout, but still an amazing staple pizza. <br><br>Cal Italia: Three different cheeses, proscuitto, and some sort of balsamic reduction sauce, this pizza had no lacking of flavor. It was almost a bit too basalmic-y for my taste, and the prosciutto was a bit on the salty side for my liking, but it was still good. <br><br>Our server was also very friendly and patient with us as we figured out what we wanted, and she was very attentive as well. <br><br>I&#39;d go as far as to say that the sausage and stout pizza is on my top three list of favorite pizzas of all time.

The pizza did not come out scolding hot and was ready to eat right away.

Choose a slice or opt for stromboli, calzone, and sandwiches.<br><br>* Californian pizza with NY style crust ($5): One of the best crusts I&#39;ve ever had; it&#39;s super thin, firm, foldable, a light char from the pizza oven, and crispy. The edges of the crust are puffy. The crispy yet chewy crust is addictive. The slice is topped with sweet creamy ricotta cheese, mozzarella, thinly sliced onions, peppers and mushrooms. There isn&#39;t too much cheese and it isn&#39;t greasy. The tomato sauce is just right. <br><br>It&#39;s a charming spot with one table inside and outdoor seating.

The Sicilian pizzas are oblong and served in the pans they&#39;re baked in.  I ordered iced tea and had a choice of sweetened raspberry or bottled and very slightly sweetened Tazo black tea.  I chose the latter and it was perfect, what I would expect from Tazo.  <br><br>Anna ordered meatballs to take home to her husband and I followed suit.  A container of 6+ good size meatballs w/ sauce cost only $5!   Portions are generous and dishes are well prepared.  Sometimes when I go out w/ these ladies the company outshines the food.  In this case, they enhanced and complimented each other.  We had a great time together as always and ate exceedingly well.  If I lived in San Francisco I&#39;d be over here all the time.<br><br>Tonight for dinner Alan and I shared the three pieces of pizza and the meatballs, a little pasta and the brussels sprouts I cooked yesterday.  It was a sumptuous repast.  Even reheated, the pizza was excellent, although not as revelatory as it was straight from the pizza oven.  The meatballs were delicious and their texture was exquisite.  The sauce was flavorful.  It&#39;s been many years since we spent much time in North Beach, but this was so delicious, I don&#39;t think it will be that long before I find a way to come back.", "reviewer_name": "Toni M.", "page": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/tonys-pizza-napoletana-san-francisco?osq=pizza"},

Not too heavy on the dressing, and the greens were bite size.  The shaved parmagiano reggiano topped it all off.<br><br>We came for the authentic Margherita and it did not disappoint.  The authentic Italian imported ingredients really sets it apart from all other pizzas in the area.  Not too mention that a 900 degree wood-fired oven also helps out in charring the crust just right.  The crust was thin, with a little crispness, and some good chew consistency.  The sauce was perfect.  The mozzarella, basil, sea salt, and olive oil all added to the perfection beautifully.  The middle does tend to sag due to the sauce, but to me, that&#39;s normal.<br><br>We had also ordered a Prosciutto e Pomodorini pizza, which is cooked in an Italian domed brick oven with similarly fresh ingredients of Prosciutto di Parma, arugula, and heirloom cherry tomatoes.  I was a little put off at first when it came to our table. The crust&#39;s edge looked like it had been formed, almost mimicking a Pizza Hut-style pizza.  I thought it should&#39;ve looked like the Napoletana-style, a little flatter, but it reminded me of his pizzas at Pyzanno&#39;s.  Taste wise, the toppings selection were great on this. The crust is a little thicker than the Napoletana, but it was good.  We didn&#39;t really get to finish this, but upon taking it home and re-heating it on the grill, it was excellent.  I preferred the wood-fired Napoletana-style better though.<br><br>We didn&#39;t experience any of the bad service from staff that some cried about.  Everyone seem to be friendly and helpful, especially since we had our little one with us.  I thought for a moment that Tony was goin&#39; to serve up #32 (or whatever # it was) of 73 to us, but alas, he skipped our table.  I&#39;m sure this  place gets busy later in the evening, so you do risk waiting (especially if you plan to have a large party, but don&#39;t intend to make reservations ahead of time).  I definitely want to come back to try the other pies (New Haven being one of them) and the pasta.", "reviewer_name": "Jeff T.", "page": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/tonys-pizza-napoletana-san-francisco?osq=pizza"},

At the most you&#39;ll stretch out across a small bar facing a wall, but that wall is fabulous with its vast sticker collection ranging from Kurt Cobain&#39;s mug to Beatles lyrics. <br> The day we went a young woman was the barmaid/waitress/pizza guru and she was perfect. Took our order (2 combos, one with 2 slices of pepperoni and the other with 1 clam/garlic one cheese). She made sure everyone in the joint was comfortable, had drinks in front of them and even talked sports with the locals. <br> The pizza was amazing! The garlic clam pizza has left me dreaming of my return this July. I cannot recommend it enough. GET.IT.<br> Do yourselves a favor and try it out.

The white pie is a bit of a misnomer, considering it combines mozzarella, feta, garlic, and olive oil with colorful zucchini and tomatoes. A selection of cracker-thin crust varieties are available as well. It&#39;s not likely you&#39;ll have room for the delicious housemade cheesecake, but gelato is known to aid with digestion, at least in Italian families.

I&#39;ve eaten here (well, mostly take out) dozens of times--I remember a time when I got pizza here once a week. Both the thin and deep dish pizzas are excellent--spicy, flavorful sauce and crispy, perfectly textured crusts in both cases. I think the deep dish here is a little better than Zachary&#39;s, but it&#39;s a close call. It&#39;s definitely better than the crap I just had in Chicago--totally due to my own bad decision in the place, I&#39;m sure (or so I&#39;ve been told...now I have to wait til next time damnit!!). But actually perhaps my favorite thing at Little Star (other than the fab jukebox) are the the chicken wings--so. good. This deep affinity could have something to do with my pizza burnout, but really I&#39;ve always loved the wings....just more so lately. Cheap PBRs (normally like $2 a can I think?) are a plus, too. And the champagne cocktails are served in a huge glass--or at least they were, last time I ate inside. I knocked off a star because I was truly annoyed when this place switched to CASH ONLY! WTF?

No arguments there.   It was missing the parm shaved on top that we saw on the first salad which would have been nice since we were already teased with it.  Salad was dang good still.<br><br>We decided to order the New York pizza because I had seen good reviews about it on Yelp.  It was a thin kinda crust, a little too crunchy for us but we were already warned.  It had a lot of meat which we are more simple than that-we should have just stuck with one kind of meat.  Meatlovers would love this.  So needless to say I think we may have ordered the wrong thing to our liking but it was still good just a little too much.  Like I said the whole menu thing was confusing.  <br><br>So the star of the show was ....drum roll....the kids mac and cheese.  I think it was the best mac and cheese we ever had.  My daughter ate probably less than half (it was a big bowl) and the BF ate most of the rest.  It seriously was his favorite thing we had here. LOL  The mac was big mac noodles with a homemade cheesy cream sauce.  Fantastic and on the children&#39;s menu! haha<br><br>Bathrooms were clean.  There was only one bathroom with a sign and people were waiting in line the whole time.  Totally awkward-in front of tables.  When I got up to wait the chickie finally told me that there was another next to it.  Hmm nice to put a sign and maybe make them a men/womens.  Just a little thing.<br><br>Super good.  Great server.  Cool ambiance.  We will be back the next time we visit but may try a 900 degrees (versus the 1000 degrees) pizza - I think that&#39;s the one that leaves the crust a little doughy.  Still confusing.  LOL  The bill was around $60 minus the tip - most expensive lunch we had while in San Fran (with just sodas).", "reviewer_name": "Carissa C.", "page": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/tonys-pizza-napoletana-san-francisco?osq=pizza"},

We went with one deep dish and one thin, both pepperoni and sausage. To our waiter&#39;s surprise we demolished every last bit. Deep dish pizza is one of my favorite things and this rivaled the best I&#39;ve had in Chicago and outshone several of them. The crust was the perfect blend of crispy buttery-ness and pillow-y lightness. The sauce was well seasoned and complex without alienating the teenagers and the cheese was high quality and plentiful.

We got the Giant Meatball and the award winning Margherita Neapolitan style pizza. Both were absolutely incredible! The pizza was very light and airy, and the meatball was incredibly flavorful. However, if you are expecting to get a slice with a firm, crunchy crust, that is NOT what this style of pizza is. Neapolitan is supposed to have a fluffy crust with a somewhat wet center, so complaints about the pizza&#39;s &#39;soggyness&#39; are a reflection on customer preference, and not the pizza&#39;s preparation. Luckily, they have a tone of different pizza styles if you don&#39;t like Neapolitan style. We sat at the bar, and the bar tender was very attentive and friendly.

And I really appreciate that. I went to dinner with a couple of friends, and included in the trio is a vegetarian. So needless to say, when searching for dinner venues we&#39;re confined to those that accommodate vegetarians and the lactose-intolerant. And here, all three palates were happily fed.

Definitely more of a date restaurant than a pizza joint and the price reflects that. The deep dish is very deep (the two of us only managed to cram down half of a large pie), the corn bread style crust is revolutionary, and I love the sauce on top style. I also love the fact that the drink selection is cheap and reasonably priced. I HATE restaurants that overcharge for drinks, I go for the food not to pay $3 for a coke or $6 for a beer and Little Star understands that. My only complaints, which are by no means reasons not to go there, are that there could be a little more variety on their &#34;specialty&#34; pizzas, I would expect some more unique ingredients and combinations out of a place like this and the second would be that the sauce could use a little work. Maybe it was just the day that I was there but the sauce struck me as a little too tart, perhaps undercooked, and not salty sweet like I like my pizza sauce.

Parked. Went in and waited for another 20-25 minutes. The hostess was very nice, and came over to us to give us updates on our table every so often. We get seated finally - waitress brings over water, we put in our order for garlic bread and their special for the night - Large thin-crust pizza with pancetta, arugula, mozarella and fontina cheese. The bread came out fairly quickly, was OK - it&#39;s french bread (very soft, yum) served with a tiny bowl of butter and huge bunch of garlic cloves you spread on yourself. The pizza was good, but reeeally salty cos of the pancetta - so I ended up taking all the pancetta off.. but other than that, was pretty good... didn&#39;t like the crust very much, ended up not eating it. The waitress was very attentive and nice.  She even sliced the 3rd slice of pizza in half so we could split it evenly for our take-out boxes, haha.  With my glass of sauvignon blanc and my friend&#39;s ginger beer, the bill came out to be around $40 - so $20 per person, not too bad...

I was hyptonized first by the fact that Golden Boy has a window display of piping hot pizzas from their deck ovens. Walking past the narrow bar stool alley and situating myself in the rear while I waited for my friends, I was further hypnotized by the two chefs in the back going through the tedious routine of preparing dough, rotating pizzas currently in the oven, and slicing up finished pizzas. <br><br>The dough preparation had a beautiful cadence to it, and a good sign that this is pizza worth a damn. When not preparing dough, the preparers would use nothing but a chef&#39;s knife and a towel to rotate the scorching hot pizza pan without so much of a though at burning their hands. Given my fear of burning myself in a toaster oven, I would fail miserably at this feat. <br><br>At last, my party joined me and we prepared to indulge in some slices. After watching the preparers for the good part of 10 minutes like some starving creep, I proceeded to order 4 slices, doubling up on the works and rounding out my order with a pepperoni and a pesto slice. Why only 4? I had eaten dinner only two hours prior, and despite declaring myself as &#34;stuffed,&#34; one snack during into a second dinner. <br><br>Well, screw any remorse, because after my server provided me with four fresh slices of pizza and I took my first bite, holy hell was I in heaven. First of all, the Sicilian is just the perfect canvas for some quality low-moisture mozzarella, and Golden Boy matches that perfectly. The cheese marries the golden, crispy and doughy crust and sends you into pizza bliss, with each bite taking you closer to a culinary climax leaving you wanting more. <br><br>The pepperoni was exceptional, with the perfect amount of sliced, rounded meat in every bite. The works was phenomenal too, just bursting with flavor without stealing the show from the marvelous cheese or crust. As for the pesto, I expected a little more basil flavor, but still enjoyed it enough to dream of my return to Golden Boy.

Connecting brilliant ideas with brilliant actions, a couple friends and I decided to finally try Tony&#39;s after 6+ years living in the Bay Area and *still* not having tried it.<br><br>Game plan: <br>- Drive to Tony&#39;s. Utilize friend&#39;s handicap parking permit to outwit the parking apocalypse that is North Beach. Check.<br>- Arrive by noon to evade long lines and wait times. Actual arrival time 12:20pm. Opt for 0 minute wait option and eat outside. Check.<br>- Order the infamous limited-to-73-pies-a-day edition Margherita Pizza and seek out recs for other pizzas from our server. Result: Orders of the New Yorker and Detroit Style Red Hot. Check, check, check.<br>- Order more &#34;limited edition&#34; menu options - aka Meatballs Gigante with Sea Salted Buratta. X2. Duh.<br><br>Overall our weekend lunch at Tony&#39;s was superb. Three completely different styles of pie gave us a real range in our pizza experience. The floppy and light Margherita was my personal fav (I have a weakness for a simple Margh). The group in general loved the selection of hearty and spiced meats on the New Yorker on a thicker crust. Finally the Detroit Style was another change of pace with square slices of a thick, garlicy buttered crust and generous amount of cheese.

I&#39;m in my early fifties, so I come from the era when you were either an Uno&#39;s family, a Due&#39;s family, or a Gino&#39;s/Giordano&#39;s family. We were Due&#39;s fans. Then Uno&#39;s sold out to corporate interests, Due&#39;s faded, and Lou Malnati opened up his place across the street from my house back in 1971. The Brian Piccolo Foundation fundraisers and the fairly constant stream of Bears and Cubs and Blackhawks (defenseman Eric Nesterenko was another neighbor) spurred the popularity of Malnati&#39;s, but it was the pizza that made it a legend. And the family - Lou and Jean and Marc and Rick are just good people. It was nice to be in their place, they made you feel welcome. <br><br>So, like every Chicagoan, I get my jones for some of the Real Thing. I had been to Zachary&#39;s and Patxi&#39;s, and then I started hearing about Little Star, and reading all the praise here. I went there the other day and ordered the Chicago classic: sausage and onions and bell peppers and mushrooms, and, as is my habit, substituted black olives for mushrooms. <br><br>There&#39;s no doubt that this is the genuine article. No prefab Uno&#39;s, no &#34;what the hell is THIS&#34; Pizz&#39;a Chicago nonsense (and can we please punish the advertising mastermind who came up with that ridiculous spelling of &#34;pizza&#34;?) , this is a real Chicago-style deep-dish pizza. And it&#39;s a thuddingly average specimen. The crust has little too much cornmeal, it&#39;s more oily than buttery and flaky. Mine was perfectly done, but it seems like it would burn pretty easily in another minute, and that it would reheat much too tough. (It did toughen too much when reheated. Notable fail - one of the essential joys of the Real Thing is that it reheats well. I spent one summer hanging with friends, most of whom worked at Malnati&#39;s or at Gabby Hartnett&#39;s Bowling Alley across Lincoln Avenue. We&#39;d bowl and close the alley, then go across to Lou&#39;s. Lou would give whoever was working a break to sit down with us; he&#39;d often join us himself. We&#39;d order whatever we wanted, and when the bill came, it would be for one medium cheese. And when Lou learned that I lived across the street, he&#39;d always make sure I took home the leftovers. &#34;What, you got somewhere else to go so fast you can&#39;t drop this off at home first?&#34; I had leftover Malnati&#39;s for lunch at least twice a week all that summer. Rest in peace, Lou; you were a sweet man!) The cheese was very good and in the right proportion. The onions and bell peppers were UNDERCOOKED. Too much raw veg flavor, too much crunch. Only the crust and perhaps the edges of pepperoni slices are supposed to crunch in the Genuine Article, not the veggies. It&#39;s Comfort Food. <br><br>The most important part is the sauce. There&#39;s gotta be a lotta sauce. I estimate the proper sauce-to-other ingredients ratio in the Real McCoy to be about six times the ratio in your average delivery thin pizza. It has to be rich and chunky, but it ISN&#39;T just chopped tomatoes. It&#39;s a SAUCE - it has to be cooked. The Little Star sauce is so acid, so jarring with uncooked flavor, that I immediately took up knife and fork to probe and see if someone suffering from temporary insanity had put GREEN olives in my pizza instead of black. Whew - not the case. But a HUGE disappointment, after the accolades of Yelpers. <br><br>They serve the Goods here. It will quiet your Jones. And while I&#39;m sure that some of the complaints about service I read here have validity when the crowds are out the door, I showed up at 5 pm and I found the service to be very friendly, although the place is a little dark for my taste. But this deep-dish will not thrill you, it will not make you exclaim &#34;My God! It&#39;s like I never ate pizza before I tasted this!&#34; it will not excite that instant sense memory that is the essence of food nostalgia. Like Patxi&#39;s, it&#39;s good. Serviceable. More than acceptable. But it doesn&#39;t come within a mile of Zachary&#39;s, which could open up in Chicago any day and do a land-office business, even up against Malnati&#39;s.", "reviewer_name": "Randy K.", "page": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/little-star-pizza-divisadero-san-francisco-2?osq=pizza"},

My friend and I went around 7pm on a Sunday night and were seated immediately, though maybe just by luck because when we left there looked to be a long wait. Everything on the menu looked great but in my opinion all the thin crust pizzas were priced $2-3 more than the usual &#34;specialty&#34; pizza restaurant in NYC (like Roberta&#39;s). We decided on thin crust Italian and deep dish vegetarian to share. Thin crust Italian came out first (and fast!) and it was actually way better than I expected.. something about the garlicky crust was unique to what I&#39;ve had before. Trying not to make ourselves full we anxiously awaited the deep dish vegetarian. SO GOOD. We took home the leftovers and let me tell you.. they were just as good cold. Hipster servers (I live in Williamsburg so I can say that) were nice.. but I mean your usual hipster servers. Crowd was mixed.. definitely a good place to come with friends and share plates.

My girlfriend made the call, and since I was working out of our hotel room - with heavy deadlines - she asked the woman who answered if they would take my credit card over the phone so she could go pick up the order. The woman said yes, and the promptly hung up...WTF??? We called back, and then ordered 1 each of the Margherita and Honey pie. We paid over the phone, but since we had the initial disconnect I felt it was best that we go to pick up the order together. We were never given an order # (which is important to how their process works - so be sure to get one when you order over the phone). We were told the order would be about 20 minutes, and so we arrived 20 minutes later. The woman behind the counter (I think the same one who took our order) said it would just be a couple of minutes. We waited about 20 more minutes, and almost got the wrong order given to us. The staff was not warm, however they were very busy (it was lunchtime after all).

I found a parking spot right at the door, I guess if I like it I&#39;ll be returning at 10 pm on Sundays because this seems too easy for a top reviewed place. Um, no line? Walked in and ordered right away from the braided beauty behind the counter. I had intended on ordering every available slice choice but it&#39;s a cash only joint and I wasn&#39;t about to pay their fees from the ATM in the back. I settled on a cheese and a pepperoni slice since I only had $8. I got it to go so it was wrapped in two pieces of checkered paper and stuffed in a bag. I was expecting a small box but no big deal. The dough is a thick pan style with a soft bottom crust. The only crunch you&#39;ll get is from the crispy cheese edges. It&#39;s doughy but not chewy. I&#39;m pretty sure what gives this pizza the great flavor is the sauce. The dough is good, the cheese and seasonings are great, but the sauce is awesome! It makes the pizza.

I never tried a Margherita pizza in the US, thus this is my first in the US. The crust was cooked in a stone oven, but it was maybe a tad too thin towards the center of the pizza. My understanding was that crust is suppose to be slightly crispy due to the fact that its cooked above 800 degrees F. The crust was crispy towards the edge, but since it was too thin near the center, the cheese and oil soften the center. The crust was still good tho, you just have to becareful when you eat. You could taste all the ingredients and nothing was too overwhelming or masked any of the other toppings. But this is a margherita after all.  This is the type of pizza was more of a snack for us fat Americans, but its one of those specialties of Tony&#39;s.<br><br>Atmosphere/Service<br>the wait was ok for this place, about 20mins on a thursday around 6pm. service was speedy. we asked the waitress for recommendations, she explained the differences on the menu but didnt really give us recommendations. <br><br>Conclusion<br>Cute place.

There is limited outside seating, somewhere in the range of 6-7 tables. The inside dining room is actually two rooms that are joined by a narrow hallway. We arrived for lunch and the wait for the table was about 30 minutes, and that is exactly how long it took. They can call you when the table is ready so you&#39;re free to mingle around if you don&#39;t feel like waiting at the spot.<br><br>We were seated in the smaller room, next to the entrance and opposite of the bar. The decor is pure old school San Francisco, almost out of the Dirty Harry movie. Leather booths, minimal artwork, long bar, very soft lighting...<br><br>The server was at the table in very shortly and brought food and wine menu. I am not much of a wine person and decided to go with Anchor Liberty IPA off the draft. The beer selection is not the best I have seen but more than appropriate for an Italian restaurant. They have a multitude of mixed drinks and wines on the menu so no one gets disappointed.<br><br>We ordered some meatballs and a Caprese salad to share for an appetizer. The meatballs were superb with tomato sauce very flavorful and the beef perfectly seasoned and soft, but not spongy. I was a bit surprised with Caprese as it came with mixed greens layered in between sliced mozzarella and tomatoes. It was still good, albeit nontraditional.<br><br>For the main course we had to go with the pizza. With so many different styles to choose and different crusts baked at different temperatures, it is not easy to make a selection. But being here for the first time the choice is easy: the award winning Margherita. After all, the restaurant has it right in their name: Pizza Napoletana. The price is a bit steep at $19 for a pie that is not huge by any means. To be honest I could probably finish the whole thing by myself with no issues. However, on the day of our visit we had numerous snacks the same afternoon and were not starving so the appetizer and the pizza hit the spot.<br><br>Tony&#39;s Margherita is really that good as they say. Dough is thin but soft at all the right places with a bit of a burn on the crust. The cheese shines through and fresh tomato+basil flavors come through as expected from the minimal, but effective combination of toppings. I cannot say that Tony&#39;s is the best Neapolitan pizza I ever tried but it&#39;s damn close...<br><br>If you really want to try Neapolitan pizza the way it is supposed to be, Tony&#39;s is a no-brainer.

The first, was a 16&#34; medium crust cheese and pesto. The crusty, traditional flour crust gave a good solid, almost crunchy contrast to a hot, wet, topping of melted mozzarella and fresh pesto.

It usually comes with mushrooms, but we opted not to have them. This being said, I now believe the mushrooms would have been a fine addition. Even without the mushrooms, the pizza was fantastic. The crust was more of a corn meal mix with a gritty, well browned outside to it that give it a unique opposing texture in the mouth. The bed of the crust was lined with mozzarella, then the vegetables were in the middle, with a bed of tomatoes resting on top. Outstanding. The combinations are well thought out, balanced and tasty.

We drove right past it even though we had a map and the address. We went on a Saturday evening around 5:45pm, and the place was already pretty crowded.  We were seated right away, which turned out to be the only positive about this experience.  And since we knew what we wanted, the waiter had our order immediately.  When we saw a lot of people streaming in to line up at the cashier, we realized they were here for take-out orders, and at one time there were more people standing in line than those sitting down at the tables.  After waiting for about 20 minutes, I started to see a pattern.  Waiters were coming out of the kitchen with stacks of big and small take-out boxes, but most of the eat in customers were kept waiting. As the time went by I started to get impatient and wanted to leave.  Finally after 55 minutes, our two small 9 in. pizzas arrived separately.  But I had totally lost my appetite.  The deep dish mediterranean chicken is average and the thin crust pesto is nothing special.  We each had one slice and decided to leave. I will never go back.Total disappointment!  The food was definitely not worth the 55 min. wait time.  Final words: Don&#39;t go there when you are hungry, and prepare to wait an hour for something you can get at any pizzeria.", "reviewer_name": "Mia C.", "page": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/little-star-pizza-divisadero-san-francisco-2?osq=pizza"},

You should know that this pizza is on focaccia bread. That is what makes it so unique, but that could also be why some people don&#39;t like it. Just FYI :)<br><br>I was in SF for work, so I was spending a lot of time eating alone. This restaurant it perfect for dining solo. They actually have zero tables. It is only bar seating.<br><br>I hate going new places alone and feeling super out of place because I don&#39;t know what is going on. Assuming that other people have the same fear I want to let you know what I learned from visiting.... You walk in and order right away standing at the bar. You can order for here or to go. Then you pay, CASH ONLY! They hand you your slice and you either find a seat or head back out the front door. I didn&#39;t realize this and just took a seat and assumed I would order after. Not the case. Luckily one of the girls behind the bar was nice and accommodating. <br><br> Yummy and would return. Just know what to expect. <br><br>Key takeaways<br>1. Not good for groups.

(You can do this on your cell phone right outside the restaurant, this drops wait time down to 30 min) Pick up your pizza, grab a blanket, six pack of beer, wine or soda, and go across the street to Washington Square Park and have a picnic, relax and people watch. Don&#39;t want to do the whole picnic you can still order the pizza to go and sit at the tables outside of the slice house.  Also stick to the New Yorker it&#39;s what the place is famous for.

He quoted us a hour and a half wait, we gave him our number at 7:15 and they sent a &#34;welcome&#34; test text at that time. When we checked back at 8:30 he said we only had been waiting a half hour, when I showed him the text from 7:15 he made up some lame excuse and said we&#39;d have to eat outside or go back to the bottom of the list.

He essentially tried to publicly humiliate us.<br><br>We walked in and we&#39;re told there was a 30 minute wait, which is very fair and normal. We grabbed a spot at the bar to buy ourselves some time and get a drink. Multiple tables then cleared up and Chase told us that we were not allowed to switch to a table from our bar seat because of company policy. We asked to speak to a manager and he said he got a manager but the manager never came, it is safe to assume Chase lied. He then proceeded to seat people that just walked in to both the tables we wanted while the manager was allegedly coming over, well he lied again and blamed it on company policy, saying &#34;there&#39;s nothing I can do&#34; and walking away.<br><br>When my wife and I decided to not order any more drinks, cancel our pizza order and leave for the pizza place next door because of how rude Chase was he said to our bartender (who was very polite) &#34;hey these tourists want to cancel their pizza order&#34;. <br><br>Another party that he was friends with walked in and we heard him say &#34;guys what took you so long I texted and called you trying to save the table but it got taken&#34;. That tells me Chase was holding the table out for his buddies while we tried to switch to it, then he gave it to a couple that walked in when all we wanted was to have a nice meal at a table 2 feet from us. <br><br>Literally instead of spending $85 at Tony&#39;s we went around the corner and spent $85 at Calzone&#39;s and $10 at Tony&#39;s on 2 drinks. Doesn&#39;t seem like a good trade off for Chase or for his employer. Why employers let a brat like that ruin the company&#39;s reputation is beyond me. I highly recommend going to Calzone&#39;s around the corner instead of Tony&#39;s.

Unless you&#39;re from Detroit, you probably couldn&#39;t care less about my fascination, but for fellow former-Detroiters, this is your Buddy&#39;s/Louis&#39;/Cloverleaf/Jets&#39; style, and it&#39;s very good.

They had this challenge once on FoodTV between Chicago style and New York style - fire fighters from Chicago and police officers from NY both tasting both. As you might guess, the fire fighters picked Chicago style and the police officers picked NY. I have a hunch that people that don&#39;t like GB are used to thin crust California style pizza. I actually happen to love all four styles - Chicago (Little Star is best), New York (I don&#39;t know, is Tomasso&#39;s NY style? If so, it&#39;s my favorite), Detroit (GB), and California (Gialina&#39;s, Arizmendi&#39;s, Cheese Board, maybe Delfina&#39;s, or Flour &amp; Water?, which I have yet to try).

The receipt from Tony&#39;s identified Alexandra as the employee who processed the order for a caesar salad and a Di Lucca pizza. I had ordered a St. Anthony pizza, NOT a Di Lucca. Also, Di Lucca pizza was not listed on the UberEats menu and so there was no way that I could have made a mistake in ordering. What irks me is too is that Alexandra gave me a pizza that I did not order and I do not know if I overpaid for that pizza. The St. Anthony has sausage on it and the Di Lucca was like a cheese pizza with a can of tomato thrown on top, totally not what I expected. I ate one slice and put the pizza aside.

{"reviewe_photo": "https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/6O8NjN3o3K9UcMdVntT-7Q/60s.jpg", "reviewer_comment": "Stumbled upon Golden Boy pizza while taking a friend on a tour of SF based off the recommendation of a sweet lady at the flower shop. Golden Boy pizza is pretty unremarkable on the outside, just a small red tent that says Golden Boy pizza. As you get closer, you know it&#39;s different from the rest, though. The pizza at the window is still fresh, the cheese still melting off it. Rock music blasts throughout the small bar-esque seating area, a myriad of stickers and signatures of patrons past adorn the walls, the oven&#39;s heat makes the environment warm but not to the point of being uncomfortable. <br><br>The process at the cashier is simple: order your pizza, either by the slice or by the sheet (it&#39;s square pizzas here, kids). Slices range from 3-5 per and sheets, if I remember correctly, were 48 per. Pricy, in my opinion, but the slices are worth it. I had a Clam and Garlic slice and a Combo slice. At first, I was worried since it seemed like the Clam and Garlic was pretty unpopular - the sheet was still completely full save for one slice. The Combo, on the other hand, was already ravaged through halfway. Oh yes, another note: this place is Cash Only, no cards. Not sure if there&#39;s an ATM around. <br><br>Anyways, seating is simple. Swiveling bar stools line the walls and you simply choose your seat. Kinda hard to mess up. Seating is definitely limited, so during rush hour I&#39;d imagine it to be very difficult to get a seat inside. On to the pizza. <br><br>Clam and Garlic had what I think was the Garlic adorned all over it. It had this beautiful green look to it. The garlic taste was surprisingly rather subtle for a pizza with garlic as a star in the dish. Clams, as you can imagine, were equally subtle since no pizza store can afford to throw on tons of clams onto a pizza. So, I felt like I was kinda just eating a regular cheese pizza with little bits of clams and garlic. But, the real star of the whole slice was the dough. This goes for the Combo pizza as well. The dough has all the features of a thin pizza crust: light, airy, crisp, yet it&#39;s a thick crust. It was amazing. The magic of the dough might have something to do with the fact that it&#39;s made in house. <br>Combo pizza was great, it had onions, tomato, sausage and a few  other toppings I can&#39;t remember. The sausage had a great bite to it, definitely not your regular pizza hut sausage. Tomatoes and onions were nice and refreshing as well. I didn&#39;t add any red pepper or parmesan cheese since it just didn&#39;t seem appropriate to adulterate a pizza slice so good. <br><br>All in all, four out of five stars. The pizza is in a class of it&#39;s own here, skip all those other pizza by the slice places. Clams and garlic could&#39;ve stood out a bit more, so minus the one star. Really more like half star though, but no option for that. Its grungy, yet entirely at ease atmosphere makes for easy conversation and the pizza is outstanding. It&#39;s a great second date place where the conversations can flow freely and the meal is still wholly satisfying. Or, maybe even a first date place if you really want to come out of left field and leave an impression.", "reviewer_name": "Eric T.", "page": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/golden-boy-pizza-san-francisco?osq=pizza"},

Best pizza I&#39;ve ever had, and I&#39;ve eaten a lot of pizza. The place is like this: There are always two guys at the far end of the long and narrow restaurant who are making pizzas nonstop. The bring a tray out of the oven about every ten minutes and add it to trays of pizzas at the front of the restaurant in a display area. Each tray contains maybe a dozen pieces of pizza, sliced into squares. You select the pieces you want and if they&#39;re not hot, they are heated up in an oven. That takes a couple of minutes, during which time you pay up and order something to drink. They have a good selection of sofas, including a variety of Pelegrinos. Plus red or white wine in glasses filled to the rim for $5--a great deal. Beer too, of course. Plus the pizza is cheap--super-excellent and cheap, it doesn&#39;t get better than that. You eat at a counter on a bar stool. No tables. I drive all the way across San Francisco for Golden Boy pizza. I don&#39;t do that for any other pizza, and there are scores of good pizzerias in San Francisco. My only complaint about Golden Boy is there isn&#39;t one just down the block from me.

I&#39;ve tried Patxi&#39;s (gave it 3 stars) and next on my list is Little Star, but so far Golden Boy is my favorite. Golden boy only serves the napoleon style (box shaped) pizza, they do 4-5 different topping combinations and are cash only. You&#39;ll notice a long line coming out of their small restaurant but that&#39;s partly because they put their cash register at the front of the restaurant which automatically generates a long line outside. So don&#39;t let the long line deter you. <br><br>I love the casual/fun environment of the place, their service and of course their pizza. I&#39;ve tried the supreme (I think they call it the combo pizza), cheese, pesto, vegentarian, and their garlic/clam. My favorite by far was the garlic/clam pizza. I&#39;d recommend that to people even if they don&#39;t like seafood cause I didn&#39;t think it tasted too seafood-y. The service is great here too. The gal at the register is a machine. She asks very succinct questions when you reach the front so there&#39;s no dilly dallying which got us through the line quickly. <br><br>As I was finished my first round of pizza&#39;s, I was thinking to myself, I&#39;d love 2 more slices but I don&#39;t want to get back on that line. The other gal working there must&#39;ve telepathically heard me and asked me what I wanted!

Being from St. Louis myself, I wanted to see how they crafted their version of it. It was advertised as St. Louis style, so I was sufficiently intrigued. <br><br>Starting off, the service was courteous, but inattentive. We had to ask on multiple occasions to have our drinks refilled, one guy said they didn&#39;t have any ketchup when another server said they did and brought it out to us, and so on. Kind, but markedly inattentive. <br><br>Then came the pizza. I was surprised the maximum number of toppings on their St. Louis style was 3. Imo&#39;s in St. Louis, the premier St. Louis style pizza restaurant, lets you pile them on without a hitch. As a result, Tony&#39;s pizza looked nowhere near as rich as the pies I was accustomed to eating in St. Louis. <br><br>Second, their St. Louis pie had a rim crust around it. Again, not like they do it in St. Louis (the toppings go to the edge of the pie). Another disappointment. <br><br>And their sauce was definitely on the scant side. They really don&#39;t indulge their guests on tomato sauce. <br><br>The only authentic element I could detect was the cheese. Definitely tasted like provel, so I assumed it was the genuine article. <br><br>All in all, not a bad pie, but as a St. Louisan, definitely not the real deal. I was thinking of coming back and trying their Detroit style pie, but why when their St. Louis style pie isn&#39;t what we really eat in St. Louis?<br><br>Come on guys, don&#39;t false advertise.

Some of the reviews on this place are pretty discouraging, but I feel like that&#39;s just because of super high expectations for Tony&#39;s to have a perfect pizza. <br><br>My boyfriend and I got in line about 15 minutes before they opened, and we got the last table inside. There are also tables outside, but the cold won&#39;t matter because they have heaters. We ordered the Meatball Gigante with marinara sauce and the Margherita pizza. The meatball came out within 5 minutes of ordering. It is a must try! The meat was perfectly soft and the marinara sauce was absolutely amazing. It was probably the best marinara sauce I&#39;ve ever had. They only make 25 of these a day so I definitely recommend heading there early and trying one of these. The world&#39;s best pizza, the Margherita, was also very delicious. The flavors that come from the tomato sauce, mozzarella, basil, and olive oil are combined extremely nicely with a very unique taste. It&#39;s definitely unlike any pizza I&#39;ve ever had and I would definitely get it again. And they only make 75 of these a day. The only part I didn&#39;t like about the pizza was the crust, which was kind of burnt and I didn&#39;t like the taste on my tongue, but like I said, I wasn&#39;t expecting a perfect pizza, especially since I&#39;m sure it wasn&#39;t Tony himself in the back making the pizzas. <br><br>If you&#39;re ever in SF, it is definitely worth a try. Get there about 20 minutes before they open and you can go right in when the doors open. It is a little bit on the pricey side, but nothing over the top.

A word to the inevitable critics for my claiming the 1st to Review Title: I won a golden ticket for the soft opening, so I really did go and try the food, it isn&#39;t mere speculation.<br>So, what can I say? It&#39;s Tony&#39;s. What would you expect from Mr. Gemignani? Anything less than perfection? Of course not! <br>Tony will open this little gem next to his already famous Pizza Napoletana restaurant this Friday to the public. It&#39;s a walk in place for people on the go. As you walk in you will see the huge coal fired oven just in front of you and the other huge oven (he brought that one in from Texas I think) to the left. You can order a custom pie or a true Chicago beef sando (disclaimer: they were only alloting one item per golden ticket, the wife is a vegetarian, so I sadly could not try the beef sando. I spoke to someone who was enjoying one though who said it was &#34;awesome&#34;). We ordered a half cheese / half pepperoni thin crust from the coal-fired oven. It did not disappoint. It&#39;s all about the sauce here, folks. He slathers on a generous amount of potent, semi-spicy sauce that is just perfect. The crust couldn&#39;t be any better, and of course the cheese is cooked perfectly.<br>If you&#39;re in a hurry, go here. If you have more time, go next store to his sit down restaurant. In my opinion, it&#39;s the best pizza in SF, definitely this side of the Mississippi, and arguably in the country, although I know personal tastes vary and this will be a hotly debated topic for the forseeable future. In my camp though Tony reigns King, and I consider myself blessed that I am fortunate enough to live in SF and partake in his creations whenever I want.

The only negative is the wait time, so be prepared. We waited for a while until we just gave up and sat outside.

Having lived on the East Coast and enjoyed New Haven pizza, we came to Tonys with high standards - thin-crust, crisp and chewy crust. Now New Haven is not perfect - the cheese could be fresher (not that bagged mozz they use on the East Coast), but the crust is always perfect.<br><br>So back to Tonys. We ordered two of the award winning margherita&#39;s - baked in the 900 degree oven. The crust was a disappointment, it was actually limp. The dough flavor was good, but it was under baked. The sauce was good as was the good quality mozz.  Since this was the signature pie, we were a bit disappointed.<br><br>We also had a proscuitto, fig, arugula pie - this was the best. I believe it was baked in an electric oven. The crust was far better and it was a great balance of toppings, fresh arugula on a crispy and chewy crust. The best pizza of the one we ordered.<br><br>The New Yorker pizza with ricotta, mozz, sausage and pepperoni was just too much. It was far too heavy for a pizza - it was overloaded with flavors that masked the sauce and crust. It was the biggest pizza (in terms of diameter).<br><br>So all in all - my guests (native New Haven-ians and New Yorkers) and I agree that Tonys is a good pizza place, but best in the nation? probably not.", "reviewer_name": "Madison W.", "page": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/tonys-pizza-napoletana-san-francisco?osq=pizza"},

Finally made a trip last weekend with my family to try it out. When we got there, there was a 1.5 hour wait for a party of 4 - already prepared for a wait time like this, we put out name down and hopped on over to Cafe Divine for some wine and cheese/salami.<br><br>Our table ended up being ready about an hour and 15 minutes in. The service here was mediocre - they are just so busy. There was always a long wait, so for these servers they must be non-stop from the start to end of their shifts. <br><br>As for the food - decently priced and good tasting. I like their wide variety of pizzas with all of the different styles. Between 4 of us, we ordered a Margherita pizza, the Cal-Italia, and their Spaghetti and Meatballs. <br><br>The Margherita pizza was good, except half of our pizza was cooked perfectly and the other half was undercooked (I didn&#39;t notice till I got to the undercooked half, so didn&#39;t think to send it back) The taste of their Margherita is good - I really liked that their was a nice little salty kick to the taste. As for the Cal-Italia pizza, I had been dying to try this pizza out since the first time I saw it on Yelp. The ingredients were all very tasty, however, when it came down to it, not really my style of pizza. I LOVE Figs/Fig spread and prosciutto but I guess on pizza I like my pizzas more of the purist type (ie. Margherita). However, it was awesome to finally try it out.<br><br>Their pasta on the other hand, DEE-LISH! Their Spaghetti and Meatballs dish was excellent - perfect al-dente pasta and I loved the rounder shaped fresh pasta they use. This is a pizza place but I feel like I enjoyed their pasta more.<br><br>I probably won&#39;t return to Tony&#39;s because the wait is so long and the pizza here was good, but definitely not the best I&#39;ve had.

He then proceeded to tell us it would be a few more minutes.and for us to go outside , even though he had already paged us! What the hell?... Kind of annoying (I was a hostess for three years) and know that you should never under quote and never page people until it&#39;s ready.

We got here pretty late, but had a few friends from out of town visiting. We had taken a cab to get over here just in time before they closed, and were in line by 215am. After waiting for over 30 minutes and we were the last people in line, as soon as we came up to the window, they slammed everything on us and closed up. This is ridiculous, we were the LAST people in line, could have just served us. What&#39;s another 2 minutes? Food would have helped a lot with my hangover today. Never coming back here again, nor bringing people, a bad taste was left in my mouth, and it could have at least been from the pizza.", "reviewer_name": "Phan H.", "page": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/golden-boy-pizza-san-francisco?osq=pizza"},

We saw them assault one of the customers! Read on for the details...<br><br>We got to Golden Boy somewhat late (around 1:20 a.m.), so there was quite a line. My girlfriend assured me that the line would move quickly, so we decided to stay. After waiting for 15 - 20 minutes, we were almost at the front of the line when an employee suddenly shut the door and put cardboard over the window of the door. No explanation, nothing. I figured they might be switching over to window service, but I really wasn&#39;t sure. The guy behind us was a little confused, so he tried to pop his head in and ask as a customer was exiting. The employees yelled at him, and one of the female employees slammed the door shut *on his fingers*. When he tried to tell them what they had done, one of the other employees rudely pointed for him to leave. Talk about adding insult to injury!<br><br>I understand that they have to deal with a bunch of drunken idiots every night, but this guy was being respectful. We had been talking to him earlier in line, and he certainly was not one of the many obnoxious drunks we experienced while waiting. But regardless of the situation, it is NEVER ok to assault someone (yes, that is assault, my friends). I didn&#39;t get a chance to talk to him after that (he was so angry, he stormed off), so I have no idea if they broke one of his fingers or not. If they did, I hope he sues their asses.<br><br>When it was finally our turn in line, my girlfriend tried to talk to the employees to tell them that they had really injured the guy. They couldn&#39;t have cared less and started arguing with her. At that point, we simply left and vowed never to return. I cannot and will not support a business that treats people so poorly.

Our server was a sorta  put out this vibe that he did not wanted to be stuck with us. He had an attitude whenever we would ask for something so we opted out of asking him and just starting asking anyone that would walk by.

We ordered the coal fired New Yorker with house made fennel sausage, Calabrian sausage, ricotta, fresh mozz, pepperoni, and garlic. The bartender said it was her favorite. First of all when the pizza came out I couldn&#39;t even pick up a slice. It flopped over because the toppings were too heavy. Ok fine. I hade a knife and fork. After taking a bite the first thing I noticed was the sauce is too sweet. Totally ruined the pizza. The toppings weren&#39;t bad and the crust was delicious - clearly that&#39;s where Tony G knows his business.

I didn&#39;t think a pizza place was a good place for a sit down dinner but boy was I wrong. I went with my friend who luckily showed up an hour early to reserve our table. By the time I got there an hour later we were already getting ready to be seated. However, we were disappointed to learn that even though we got the text that we were not yet ready to be seated. They did make an effort to sit us at the next available table which was nice but took longer than I hoped it would. <br><br>When we finally sat down we were greeted with a wide array of different pizzas. There were awards peppered all over the menu. As I come from New York I didn&#39;t want to touch anything from New York so my friends and I opted for the Margherita (limited to 73 apparently but luckily They still had it I guess?) and Barcelona. I also decided to order a root beer since I was very thirsty but didn&#39;t want water. I appreciated that they served the root beer with a glass of ice. <br><br>The Barcelona came and I was disgusted because I thought I accidentally ordered pineapple pizza. However it was just eggs playing tricks on my eyes which was a relief. There were 6 small slices and I was glad we decided to get 2 pies. We handily finished it and it&#39;s hands down the best meat pizza I have ever eaten in my life. We dropped some prosciutto on the pan and we scrapped it off with our forks because perfection can not be wasted.<br><br>The Margherita came next and it had big dabs of cheese all over it. Again it was delicious, it was balanced between the sweetness of the sauce and the saltiness of the cheese. We quickly finished the pie and we asked for our receipt. Props to Tony&#39;s for not rushing us and kicking us out even though there was an hour wait for the joint. It&#39;s kind of a double edged sword. You want to sit ASAP so you want them to kick everyone eating out. But when you&#39;re eating you don&#39;t want to be rushed and we were given our time. <br><br>If money&#39;s not a problem and you want to try pizza which in NY isn&#39;t normally seen as gourmet this is the place for you.

I got my favorite combo-margherita pizza (award winning) with sausage. Sauce- perfect acidity and sweetness. Dough-no too chewy or crusty. Perfectly thin. This place was recommended to me by a friend who has documented all the best pizza shops he&#39;s visited around the world. He raved about all pizzas but particularly recommended the Detroit pizza which is square and has a perfectly melted cheesy crust all around it. It&#39;s a little more filling so we ended up getting the traditional thin crust that I usually get which as described above was very good- on my top 3 list for sure. If you look at the yelp pics, you&#39;ll see a lot of people rave about the New Yorker as a must have so I initially was going to get that but again, the way it&#39;s served is a little bigger than what we were wanting to eat. A couple next to us was having it and we did ask them what they thought. Both said they&#39;d definitely order it again and it&#39;s one of the better pizzas they&#39;ve ever had but it did not blow them out of the park per yelp. I also noticed that the crust was a little harder and thicker than the thin pizza so it depends on what you like and what you are curious about trying. What&#39;s great is that they seem to have a big variety of pizzas you can try. When I go back, I definitely try the Detroit pizza. I&#39;m curious about the cheesy crust. The bartender told me his favorite pizza was the Barcelona, so maybe you can try that too!

Other than it, it really isn&#39;t anything special. The service was prompt and the slice was prepared quickly. The lady who helped me was really nice asking if I wanted to put any peppers or parm cheese on it and asking if I would like it wrapped. <br><br>I took it like it is with a root beer all for only 4.25. I wish I could have tried all the different slices so I could give a more accurate review, but I&#39;ll probably never be back so I have to go based off the cheese slice I ordered.<br><br>A great pizza has a good crust, a great sauce, and fresh ingredients. The crust nice, buttery, and thick the way I like it. Flavor wise tough, the crust wasn&#39;t special is any sense, just a plain pizza crust. The sauce had a good flavor to it, but I wish there was a little more of it since the crust was so hefty. The biggest disappointment was the cheese. When I order a plain cheese pizza I expect it to be cheesy. Unfortunately for me it wasn&#39;t. It had barely enough to cover the crust and sauce.<br><br>All in all if you are drunk and want an okay slice for a good price this is the place.", "reviewer_name": "Nicholas S.", "page": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/golden-boy-pizza-san-francisco?osq=pizza"},

The first thing that I noticed about it was that the pizza isn&#39;t in Pie form. The pizza is a long inch thick piece of pizza crust that has stuff on it. It&#39;s about what I&#39;d expect pizza was like before it came to America, or at least how it returned to Italy. <br><br>The conistency of the crust reminded me of the deep dish pizza that domino&#39;s used to do (or still does). The edges had a nice little crispness to it. There really isn&#39;t a &#34;end crust&#34; like you get in a pie.<br><br>The downside to the pizza I had there was that the pepperoni pizza had like 5 pieces of pepperoni per slice. The combination slice, though, was chalk full of toppings. So if you&#39;re gonna go here take a look at the slices before you order and make sure you aren&#39;t going to get what is essentially a slice of cheese pizza. The pepperoni wasn&#39;t anything special. <br><br>I wouldn&#39;t make this a destination but might go out of my way while walking around North Beach to get a slice here.

Guess they get Hypnotised.<br><br>We ate here last month and had wanted to try it for a long time based on their reputation and Yelp reviews so we chose the Margherita pizza which is their Signature Pizza and only available in limited numbers of 72 per day so when its gone, its gone. We thought this would be the best way for our introduction to Tony&#39;s out of dozens of choices and there were but two of us and we didn&#39;t want to stuff ourselves with more than one pizza so we felt trying out the Signature pizza was the way to go. Well we were some what disappointed that the pizza was just average when we were expecting so much more. It was definitely a good pizza, nothing wrong with it but in world of gourmet pizza it was nothing to write home about. We were puzzled and disappointed that the Signature dish was so average. Maybe they could change the Signature pizza to something that didn&#39;t get so many complaints.<br><br> However we will be back to sample the other choices. Service was good and our waiter pleasant and knowledgeable so we had a great day. We also had an appetizer that was good but I can&#39;t remember what it was. I think it was the butter that had some outrageous North Beach honey mixed into it. I was very skeptical about the claim of NB honey but our waiter informed us that they had a beehive on the 3rd floor as well as a beekeeper to harvest the North Beach gold!<br><br> My friend Kelli who is very experienced in the food and wine industry really enjoyed the restaurant and also wants to try it again even though it was sort of a shock that the Signature pizza was just average!<br><br>Three stars for the pizza (so sad) and four stars for the dining experience.", "reviewer_name": "Neil W.", "page": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/tonys-pizza-napoletana-san-francisco?osq=pizza"},

He said we had to show up early because they make only a limited amount of margherita pizzas, and if you&#39;re gonna have pizza, that&#39;s what you want to get.  We got there an hour before they open which I thought was super early, obviously we were first in line. However, soon after, a line started forming behind us and before I knew it, the line looked almost 100 people long.  When we sat down we ordered the margherita, and also prosciutto e pomodorini. Both were amazing, I hate to say it but i think I liked the prosciutto pizza more. The only thing issue I had was the char on the bottom of the first pizza, I know that&#39;s what most people look for and like, but to me it had a sightly odd taste. Not that I hated it, just a little different.  That was there only thing keeping it from getting 5 stars.

It was called Coccoli - Italian the prosciutto do Parma was perfectly sliced and then the fried dough was not greasy but airy and had just the right amount of seasons.

The margarita pizza was just sauce, cheese and tomatoes, and to my preference I felt like it was too plain to me.<br><br>But then, I took a slice of the New Yorker and it was absolutely delicious. I had my first bite and wanted some more after that. The combination of toppings was brilliant, pepperoni, Italian sausage, mozzarella and the most important ingredient of all, ricotta cheese. The ricotta cheese made the pizza so distinctive that I have never tasted on the pizza, and every time I got to the ricotta part, I was amazed on how good it to taste. Another way of saying it is &#34;goodness in your mouth&#34;. I came here a second time and the taste was the same as before.

I am sad.<br><br>I came here with my parents and this was our first spot of the day for lunch.<br><br>PARKING:<br>It&#39;s SF, might need to park a little ways away.  Probably pay for parking.  We got lucky and parked at a meter that was out of order.  Apparently this means you can stay at the meter for 2 hours maximum and don&#39;t have to pay anything or at least that&#39;s what the sign said...<br><br>AMBIANCE:<br>It&#39;s a small cozy little place.  I like the feel of the restaurant, not super upscale but it&#39;s nice inside.  Modern looking and clean. Simple decor.<br><br>SERVICE:<br>Our server was good.  Not bad, got things done quickly.  But I just got this feeling that he wanted us to be quick about our meal?  Or maybe I just thought he&#39;d be more engaging initially but he wasn&#39;t, oh well.  I can&#39;t expect these things.  Maybe just &#39;cause I was in SF...anyways...<br><br>FOOD:<br>Bread and the condiments were tasty.  We especially liked the garlic and honey, delicious with the bread.<br><br>We got the Margherita since a friend of mine suggested it. It was tasty.  No complaints.  We liked the thin crust, crispy exterior and chewy inside.  I appreciate the San Marzano tomatoes as the sauce.  Bright, clean, flavorful.  Wish there was a bit more basil on the pizza...<br><br>My dad wanted a sandwich for some reason.  I believe he got something called the All Star.  It was half corned beef and half pastrami.  Definitely seems like the make their own corned beef.  Loved how thinly sliced all the meat was.  We all felt the corned beef was a touch too salty.  Pastrami was flavorful.  Oh and this sandwich was HUGE! We barely finished it, but it was tasty.  We also liked the little purple potato chips with it.<br><br>Hahha, my parents definitely want to come back without me [they live in Norcal] so yeah, some good stuff!", "reviewer_name": "Christopher C.", "page": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/tonys-pizza-napoletana-san-francisco?osq=pizza"},

Hmmmm...does going for dinner there Friday night and then going there for lunch that next day count?<br><br>Yup, I couldn&#39;t go 24 hours without having Tony&#39;s again. Let me tell you, this place is worth the hour wait. Now I&#39;ve been here a few times, but I stick to the same things every time because they are so damn good. Even their bread and dipping sauce is amazing. Honey and garlic. OMG. Not going to lie, when I first saw it I was a little, eh, what are they thinking here. Boy was I wrong. I literally come to Tony&#39;s now just for the garlic and honey dip. It is so unique and to die for! It&#39;s so good, I dream about it. I want to try and recreate it at home, but know it&#39;s just not going to be as good. <br><br>But enough about the garlic and honey (did I mention YUM?!). I&#39;ve had pretty much the same thing each time, and haven&#39;t tried new things just because what I&#39;ve had is so good. For starters, the giant meatball. They only make 25 per day, so if they have any left when you&#39;re there, JUST GET IT! I always get it with burrata, because who doesn&#39;t love burrata?! But for real, the creaminess of the burrata just goes so perfectly with the meatball and marinara. It&#39;s so good that with two people, in a matter of minutes that bad boy is gone. <br><br>The newest thing I&#39;ve tried is a one of a kind dish and it is FAB-U-LOUS! It&#39;s called coccoli and it&#39;s just heaven in pizza dough form. They fry the pizza dough so that it is so fluffy and sweet that it almost tastes like a donut, but then they salt and pepper it so it becomes the perfect blend of salty-sweet. So you have this fluffy pocket of heaven and you pop it open, steam going every where and that smell of deliciousness hits you in the face like a ton of bricks. But wait! That&#39;s not all of it! Then you fill that bad boy with stringy straciatella cheese and prosciutto and there you have it. The best tasting &#34;hot pocket-esque&#34; freshly made by you. IT IS SO GOOD! All the flavors just work together so perfectly. And the pizza dough comes out still so hot that the cheese is melting in there. Talk about delicious. <br><br>Now they have a ton of pizzas to choose from. Again, if they have any left when you go, just get the margherita napoletana. The crust is perfection, the sauce is so light and flavorful and then the mozzarella and with the fresh basil. It is just perfection. I have&#39;t tried any other pizzas yet because I&#39;ve been lucky enough each time, that they still are serving this pizza. They only serve 73 per day!<br><br>I love Tony&#39;s.

Mind you I&#39;ve had a lot of pizza in my life, and some foodie moments included. The reason that it was the best is probably because I would&#39;ve never expected it and it caught me off guard when I tried it. The limited margherita was good, but paled in comparison to the Eddie muenster. Yup, muenster pizza did me in. Something about the flavor combinations (lemon, crispy kale, honey, spice and bacon alongside that muenster) made my taste buds do a happy dance.

The dough was paper thin and wet...imagine if you left a tortilla chip to marinate in pizza sauce, that&#39;s what it was like. And it was burned on the bottom. The sauce was watery and it barely had any cheese or basil on it, so unfortunately the burned taste was what came through the most. Maybe we just picked the wrong style and the thicker pizzas are better? If there is a next time I&#39;ll try something different.

Party of 10... got there around 6:45 and our wait was about 2 hours. I didn&#39;t mind so much because of all the reviews. Near the 2 hour mark, I was just curious about where we were in line. I went inside to check and asked the hostess (this young Caucasian woman, I think she had a streak of red hair or something) and asked her how long does she think before we&#39;ll be seated. She said it&#39;s hard to say... okay... then I proceed to ask how many more people are in front of me? She then responds &#34;Don&#39;t worry, we got you.&#34; THAT DOESN&#39;T ANSWER ANY OF MY QUESTIONS.  She was pretty rude while she was responding, as if she couldn&#39;t be bothered with any questions. It wasn&#39;t like I was going to leave, I already invested close to 2 hours waiting. Anyway, 30 minutes later, we were finally seated.<br><br>The waiter was much better, but I forgot his name but he was pretty funny and nice. Constantly checked on our table, took out the dirty plates, and kept refilling our drinks. We ordered the calamari fritti, lillet blanc fries, garlic bread, New Yorker, Margherita, Cal Italia, and the Eddie Muenster pizza. I kind of wish I knew we got free bread... had I known, I wouldn&#39;t have ordered TWO orders of garlic bread. The free bread was pretty good, had 3 dipping sauces. Originally I thought that was the garlic bread... so I went crazy eating it. Then these 2 big platters of bread come out and I realized... THOSE WERE THE GARLIC BREAD. Oh how I wish I didn&#39;t eat so much bread... should have probably ran to the bathroom to throw up or something. The garlic bread was good too, nice and warm and had chopped garlic on top which was good. The calamari came and we got a mixture of the original and the spicy. Loved the calamari, nicely flavored. The spicy one wasn&#39;t immediately spicy, but as you eat it, you get the kick. The fries were good too with the bacon.. really sticky though because they put honey on it. The honey was something different for me... but everything was nicely balanced. Now to the pizzas.... I&#39;m no pizza expert... but I didn&#39;t really care too much for the pizzas. The New Yorker was probably my favorite for the night... but it wasn&#39;t anything extraordinary about it. The margherita that everyone raves about... just tasted like a pizza. The sauce... was kind of light and bland for me. The only thing that I really liked about it was the fresh mozzerlla cheese on there. Other than that... I didn&#39;t see what everyone was raving about. The Eddie Muenster was a bit odd... since it was sweet and savory... which really wasn&#39;t my thing. The kale was too salty on top and the cheese had honey or whatever in it. Not a very good combo and the people in my table were basically forcing themselves to finish their slice. Finally the Cal Italia.... Our waiter told us he wanted that to come last since he said he was like a dessert... I was kind of confused until it finally came... and it all made sense. The entire pizza was like a dessert... which really turned me off. I&#39;m not sure if putting honey on pizza is an authentic thing... cause if it is... I prefer the fake pizzas without the honey. The pizza was waaaaay too sweet for me. Overall, I didn&#39;t care too much for the pizzas... I think I liked the appetizers more than anything. I was kind of let down since most of the pizzas we ordered all won some type of an award... which really baffles me on what &#34;award winning&#34; pizza should taste like.<br><br>Overall, I was kind of let down by this place. Parking here is hell. Hostess... horrible and needs a new job.  Pizza... nothing spectacular... and some of them were kind of burned which left this weird coffee taste in our mouth (wasn&#39;t just me either). I feel like it&#39;s a bit overhyped here... if it&#39;s over anything, it&#39;s overly sweet. For $20 a pizza... I rather go somewhere else.", "reviewer_name": "Johnson S.", "page": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/tonys-pizza-napoletana-san-francisco?osq=pizza"},

Food was great and the people were so nice , so I decided to share this place with some family. I had family visiting from another county and were in the city for the day , decided to go to Tony&#39;s our party consisted of 12 people; 10 adults and 2 children. One of the group members went to ask for a table and said the hostess had simply said &#34;no&#34; , confused I went inside and asked the hostess (a girl with short black hair and a septum nose ring) if we could put our name down for a party of 12, I wasn&#39;t even done asking when she replied &#34;we don&#39;t do that &#34; over and over in the rudest way possible . Shocked and I bit scared I left to inform my party , we then when back in and asked a different girl that was in the front who I assume was the assistant manager (tall blonde girl ) if we could spit into two different groups and once again I wasn&#39;t even done talking when she cut me of and said no we don&#39;t split groups and I went to explain how it would be two completely separate tables and separate checks and she still said no. At this point I was very bothered by her attitude so I simply said &#34; you&#39;re telling me that if I want to eat with 4 other people at my own table you won&#39;t allow me ?&#34; And she said &#34;no because I already know what&#39;s going to happen&#34; I said &#34; no you don&#39;t you are assuming &#34; and she brushed me of told me to speak to the hostess and walked away. Finally the hostess agreed to seat us, outside if I may add and said that we were going to be seated at two separate tables. I said that was okay yet she continued to lecture me about how she didn&#39;t want to see us going from one table to another and that we couldn&#39;t share food with another table. As I mentioned my family was from another country, as I was explaining the seating arrangements and &#34;rules&#34; she rudely pushed one of our guest and proceeded to throw the menus on the table. She then sat the second part of our part at the complete opposite side of their outdoor patio even though there was an open table of the exact same size just one table away from our other guests. I always try to look for the best in people and give them the benefit of the doubt but my family felt discriminated against due to their language and appearances. San Francisco is one of the most largest tourist places in the world it is a shame if they really do treat people different based on their appearances and language. Good was good but not worth the horrible service. * one of the guys cleaning tables and picking up dishes was the only genuine and nice person from our visit! He gave us extra plates and silverware when the hostess and server failed to do so thumbs up to him!) also when we sat down we saw on the menu that their party policy allows up to 12 people so I still don&#39;t understand what the problem was.

They don&#39;t do these basic circular pizzas that everywhere else has. They have SQUARE pizzas. Pizzas cut into SQUARES. Now if you&#39;re sexually attracted to Spongebob-shaped objects or if you have a fear of circles, THIS IS THE PLACE FOR YOU.<br>The pizza was DELICIOUS. I ordered two pepperoni slices and after finishing my first one, I was kinda already full to be honest because they aren&#39;t dinky little slices. But I really couldn&#39;t wait to get back home to eat the other slice! It was SO GOOD. The pepperoni was crispy and the crust on the bread was ON POINT. It was thick, crispy, fluffy, and saucy. OMG so good<br>The only complains I have is that the place is extremely small and cramped. So for my large fatass, I kind of had to get used to it. But my padre is quite petite vertically so he kind of just fit right in. There&#39;s limited seating so I suppose you have to make due. Also, when my padre ordered the pizza, it wasn&#39;t very saucy, as if it was lacking the sauce.<br>But aside from that, if you&#39;re ever drunk or are looking for some late night munchies after cheating on your wife at the strip club around the corner, COME HERE.", "reviewer_name": "Johnny C.", "page": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/golden-boy-pizza-san-francisco?osq=pizza"},

You&#39;ll probably have to wait like an hour to get seated which is the perfect amount of time to get a margarita (or 2) from 15 Romolo and then drunkenly sprint back to Tony&#39;s in the 5 minutes they allow you before they give up your table.

What if the bathroom door was fairly busy and you can hear the flushing and feel the annoying reverberations of the closing door against your seat after more than two dozen people used the bathroom (not to mention lined up next to your table) during your entire meal?<br><br>Tony&#39;s has two bathrooms towards the end of the bar. Only one door is marked; the other door is next to the last table. Unfortunately, that&#39;s where we were seated. When we were initially brought to our table, it was not ideal as it was near the marked bathroom door (we did not realize the table was immediately next to the other door that was unmarked) but the kids were hungry after the long wait so we sat down. We were ultimately disappointed that we were not warned when we were seated (I can understand Tony&#39;s logistical predicament but feel customers should at least be responsibly warned before being seated there. A cynic would not be blamed for wondering whether others have complained in the past so this would not be a revelation to the restaurant owners and wait staff and yet they continue to seat customers there perhaps hoping they would not notice until it was too late.)<br><br>It is unfortunate since the food is excellent--bread with three different olive oil dips, deep fried green beans, meatballs, Tartufo and New York pizza. I&#39;ve lived in NYC, Boston and Los Angeles and this is among the best pizza I&#39;ve had ever. Both kids loved the breads, green beans and their cheese pizzas.<br><br>So I guess as long as you remember my public service announcement and refuse to be seated next to the mystery door, you&#39;ll have a much better experience than we did.

The creaminess of the mozzarella slices complemented the fresh basil leaves nicely. It was a good starter.<br><br>Cal-Italia:<br>So much dimension! Sweet, salty, savory, cheesy. The Cal Italia is a playground for the taste buds: paper thin proscuitto slices atop a cheesy bed of mozzarella, gorgonzola, asiago and parmesan cheeses and, of course, tomato sauce. Balsamic adds a bit of tanginess and the sweet fig preserve drizzled on top is literally (to use a cliche) the &#34;icing on the cake&#34;. MY GOODNESS. I had to control my desire to devour each slice so that I could enjoy and appreciate all the flavorful layers. It must be tasted to be fully understood and appreciated. <br><br>I will return solely for Cal Italia, for I am convinced that eating at Tony&#39;s and not ordering it should be a crime. <br><br>Next time, I&#39;ll try the meatballs and the gorgonzola fries.

This winning pie uses San Felice Flour (apparently that&#39;s special) and cooks for only 90 seconds in a 900 degree oven. 90 seconds!<br><br>So while waiting 90 seconds for our pie, they served us complimentary house bread with 3 dipping sauces. The first was olive oil with chopped raw garlic, the second was plain olive oil, and the third was olive oil with some pesto. The garlic one was the big winner. The house bread was fantastic and consisted of two types - a focaccia which had a nice flavor and big slices of something like pugliese.<br><br>I have to say the pizza looked beautiful with lots of bright red tomatoes, big splotches of fresh mozz, and basil leaves. The crust texture was perfect but was a little on the bitter side. (That crust bitterness reminded me of Lombardi&#39;s in New York.) Overall the pie was actually a little bland. I prefer shredded basil to get better basil coverage and thus more basil per bite. Oddly enough even though it was a little bland, there were some bites that were overly salty. These are minor criticisms because I thought the pie was very good on the whole. I just see ways for improvement. FYI: The Marg is $18 and on the small side for feeding two people.

We were a party of 7 that came in around 9:45. No tables were available so they sat us in the last table at the end of the row of tables outside. When our waitress arrived 10 minutes after we sat, she seemed to have some sort of attitude and didn&#39;t even ask what we wanted to drink, we had to tell her. Then I asked if we could get bread - it is $3 per bread basket and $7 for garlic bread! Wtf?! When do you pay for bread at an Italian restaurant ? One that I won&#39;t be going back to that&#39;s forsure! So then we ordered our food shortly. Someone in our party wanted ranch - an additional 75 cents?! STINGY! It took a little over 40 minutes for food to start arriving. Everyone was slowly getting there food one by one (a thing I ABSOLUTELY HATE, just bring the food all at once!) My dinner ended up taking the longest and I had to ask where it was. When the food finally arrived, it was piping hot and tasted good, it was just so late and I felt sick to my stomach after.

No big deal, but it was nice that she was so apologetic.  So we immediately get seated at a table right next to the original one.<br><br>Sadly, they were out of the world famous margherita pizza, but not a problem as that&#39;s never my pizza of choice--bring on the meat!  We split a lot of different items:<br><br>-Quattro Formaggio -- delicious pizza loaded with multiples types of cheese (probably my least fav pizza)<br>-Rotelli pasta -- which comes with Pesto Sauce, Sun Dried Tomatoes, Marinated Artichoke Hearts, Mozz, Parmigiano.  This was awesome, but definitely a heavier pasta dish.<br>-Penne -- Arrabiata  with a very Spicy Bolognese Sauce, Calabrese Peppers, Sliced Fennel Sausage.  Loved this pasta dish, but be careful if you&#39;re not into spicy food.<br>Scarola con Pancetta -- my favorite pizza that came served with crushed red pepper, mozz, pancetta, goat cheese, escarole, and sweet picante peppers. Sooooo SPICY! Be careful! :)<br>-Romano&#39;s original 1950s Stromboli -- this was also pretty awesome.  Super filling, it was filled with Ham, Sliced Italian Sausage, Pepperoni, Sweet Peppers, Mozzarella, American Cheese.<br><br>Serivce was great, prices are a bit steep, but the pizza is awesome and the atmosphere is great.  Good spot for large parties and the bar would be perfect for 2 ppl.", "reviewer_name": "Jenny W.", "page": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/tonys-pizza-napoletana-san-francisco?osq=pizza"},

Before the pizza had even arrived, I was already planning our next visit on the merit of this drink alone. Fortunately, the pizza arrived before I could finish and order another. With palate cleansed, it was time to order another round. This time I tried the House Negroni. I truly appreciated the bartender&#39;s fair warning regarding one of the ingredients, Campari, as he considered it an acquired taste and offered to prepare another drink if I didn&#39;t like this one.

The salad was decent but I would have liked more anchovies in my dressing. We didn&#39;t get there in time to get one of the coveted 73 Margherita pies of the day but the version we got was pretty damn good so I am intrigued to see how much better it would be with the San Felice flour dough. The Cal Italia is a Food Network Gold Medal winner but it was not a favorite among my group. The Croatian Fig Preserve just did not mesh well with the other ingredients in this pizza, in my humble opinion. I didn&#39;t care for the sweetness of this pie. The Spaghetti &amp; Meatballs was my favorite dish. The pasta was thick and freshly made, the meatballs were juicy and the tomato sauce was just perfect. <br><br>The bill was $100 for the 4 of us, which is quite reasonable.

I was not expecting much from a mere little pizza place in San Francisco. To me, pizza is pizza. Any pizza is good to me. <br><br>As soon as they brought out first  famous Margherita pizza, I was in awe. An explosion of taste and delicacy took place in my mouth. I could not believe this little pizza, simple yet quite fascinating, was being made in this  little pizza place. My group of fellow eaters kept ordering different pizzas. Slice after Slice, I kept eating. Each pizza pie brought different taste and textures. All I can say was my dining experience was awesome.<br><br>I am a huge advocate of fresh food. And let me tell you, everything here is super fresh. From the fresh tomato sauce to fresh mozzarella cheese, freshness just brings out the unique individuality of food. It makes the experience so much better. They use wood burning ovens which gives the pizza an extra special pizazz.  I believe Tony was after quality.<br><br>Now for my rating. The quality of the pizza alone deserves 4 stars. I would give it 5 but the place is not perfect. The size of the pizzas really got me. It could have been a bit bigger. I was basically paying for a medium thin crust pizza the same price as a large pizza from any where else. Also, parking is like finding gold. Tony&#39;s is right in the heart of North Beach. So if you come, please come early before prime time dinner, or you will be looking for parking for a while and then you have to wait to get seated at Tonys.<br><br>Other than those rants, This place is the best pizza place I been.

My son is five so you can imagine that this has happened before.  Usually, restaurant staff clean up such things and bring you another on the house. Not here. Our server cleaned it up only after we hunted her down, then never asked me if I wanted another beer. I only got another after I asked for one and yes, they charged me another $3 for it. <br><br>We dined under a speaker that blared what my husband<br>called, &#34;Liquid Metal&#34; music onto our heads and when we asked if the music could be changed we were told no, because it was playing on an iPod shuffle. So we ate and tried to talk over the harsh drum banging and searing guitar for another 20 minutes until we actually saw someone scramble up a ladder then do what we were told wasn&#39;t possible, change the music! Then oh joy, we got to hear rap music for the rest of our visit. We were here during the North Beach Street Festival so several members of the staff let us know they&#39;d gone deaf during the event. Obviously! <br><br>Our own server pretty much sleepwalked through our dining experience. She was more interested in watching the golf tournament on the TV over the bar than taking care of us. She offered nothing that made eating at Tony&#39;s more enjoyable. In fact, she didn&#39;t even offer any of the usual fun stuff that apparently comes with being a patron here. Another diner told us they&#39;ll bring pizza dough out for your kids to play with. Our kids got some after WE asked about it. We would have never known otherwise! <br><br>But like I said, the food was great. I recommend starting with the spinach salad (goat cheese, pine nuts, red onion, balsamic reduction, olive oil) and following it up with the Cholula pizza (mozzarella, marinated chicken breast in Cholula Hot Sauce, sliced Jalapeños, garlic, red onion, chorizo).

The wait turned out to be less than an hour almost so that was a pleasant surprise. <br><br>The menu is a bit daunting with all the styles of pizza but we had to try the classic Margherita and luckily they had 3 left! This cooks the fastest so it was brought out in minutes and was oozy goodness. it was perfect timing, we had just finished our meatball appetizer which was good but not memorable. The margherita is a must and I can&#39;t wait to compare it to the ones in Italy when I go in September.<br><br>The best part of the meal however was Cal Italia pizza which is award winning . We wanted a pizza with prosciutto but with a different taste than the margherita and this was perfect. I only have 1 word for the first bite (and second and third...) : Orgasmic!

Sure, everyone&#39;s got a preconceived list of favorite dishes in their heads, but can they actually remember what it&#39;s like to eat them?<br><br>Just for kicks, let&#39;s say you love clam chowder. It&#39;s your favorite dish. The tastiest thing you&#39;ve ever had...Well, you&#39;re a damn fool because soup sucks (it&#39;s just salty water), but I digress. <br><br>Now, can you close your eyes, toss your head back, and remember what the best bowl of New England&#39;s finest tastes like? Can you recall the rich heft of salty butterfat lapped up then bathed over your tastebuds? What about the mealy give of an overstewed potato as it thaws between your teeth? Or the slickness of mollusk-perfumed cream lingering on your balmy lips? I just went from five to midnight.<br><br>So, then, can you? Do you? I can. And I do. I remember everything. I remember walking down Stockton Street on a slightly-too-cold afternoon. I remember my gut trying to claw its way out my midsection, us having waited forty minutes for a table. I remember the dank, over-lacquered burgundy furnishings. I remember the sunset glow of the sideroom stone oven. I remember the infernal smacking of the hipster girl across from us as she ate her lunch, and I remember my fists balled up ready to knock the ugly out of her thick framed glasses. I remember the congeniality of our waiter. I remember mountains of complimentary bread. I remember a lot of good but otherwise forgettable food.<br><br>And then it came. Margherita. My queen. Hovering above us, it steadied itself on the server&#39;s fingers as he placed a tray stand in the middle of our table. A perfectly imperfect circle, it jutted out in weird places, as though it were, or had once been, alive. And, to a certain degree, it was. The cheese sizzled and seethed, the sweaty fists of steam roiled, and the sauce swam within itself, shimmering with promise. Now, I don&#39;t want to sound profane, but gastronomic desire is not so different from its sexual counterpart, and so, at that moment, I was one horny bastard. <br><br>Thus, despite all my reservations about indulging in piping hot pizza, I dug in. And while the roof of my mouth was indeed ravaged, it was worth it. The toppings being distributed inequitably (as they should), one bite was creamy, another was sharp, and yet another, grassy. Each leaving just a hint of its character in the subsequent bite. Floppy by virtue of saturation (but not inundation), the paper-thin pie still managed to have a firm bite to it, like great pasta. The sauce itself was light and smooth, almost watery, with no acerbic edge, but robust with tomato flavor. Ideal for carrying the richness of melted mounds of snow white dairy. The crust, bready, airy, but with a tinge of crinkle, was all the best things about the ass of a pizza brought together.<br><br>But there was something there more important than mouthfeel, or flavor, or delicacy. It&#39;s that thing you just can&#39;t put your finger on when something truly amazing happens. How do I say this--it was a belt or shock or tinge of enlightenment. Unfiltered happiness. And maybe it&#39;s because I am a lonely, lonely guy, but I feel a truly great meal is like a fine woman (or man--your mileage may vary). It fills your chest with satisfaction in a way that only the most primal of indulgences can. It is, too, philosophical, the memory giving you insight, perspective, and daydream fodder. <br><br>Let me put it to you in fewer words. This was the single greatest thing I&#39;ve ever eaten.

We sat down and talked and chilled and when I realized my bag was gone. I had my purse stolen INSIDE the restaurant. I talked to the staff and no one did anything about it. They didn&#39;t even look around or ask the patrons about it. NOTHING. We asked about the surveillance camera and they refused to give us access to it. Inside my bag I had my wallet with my cards and my drivers license, I had my sweaters, my go pro , a bottle of champagne for the night and much more. I&#39;m from Brazil and I&#39;ve been to some grungy places , but I&#39;ve NEVER had anything stolen from me INSIDE A RESTAURANT. that&#39;s absurd !!! What kind of trashy place is this ???

Whenever I get the chance, I come here for it. I also really like their combo pizza, they put zucchini on it which I love! They put on just enough sauce rather than slathering it like some places do, so you can still taste all the toppings. Their prices are pretty reasonable too. The inside is fairly small so its def more of a take out place. The only downside in my opinion is that even late at night there is often a huge line. Takes a while to move through it too but to me the wait is worth it. Just don&#39;t expect to stop by to quickly grab a slice because there is nearly always a wait.

I was impressed.  I&#39;ve had this combination on salads before and this was very good, but not the best.  I&#39;m not sure what it was lacking but I think it could be slightly improved.  <br><br>Next was the pizza, superb!  The crust is simply out if this world, a perfectly divine combination of crisp and chewy with that nice wood burned fire flavor.  Honestly, the crust in the middle of the pizza was a little on the softer side, almost too much but the outer rim made up for it.  My friend thought there was too much olive oil but the truth is I loved every drippy bite of it.  The mozzarella and basil were fresh tasty as well.  The sauce is really just pure tomatoes of the highest quality, very simple.  <br><br>Overall, I&#39;d say the crust is what makes the pizza.  There was nothing wrong with the toppings, but margarita pizza has never been my favorite so I&#39;m looking forward to trying other combinations.  However, I know that only the margarita gets the special flour flown in from Italy, so perhaps the other crusts won&#39;t compare.  I can&#39;t wait to return and try more! Split two ways, drinking water, my share of the meal with tip was $18, not bad for an upscale restaurant and some of the best pizza I&#39;ve ever had (and yes, I&#39;ve had pizza all over Italy as well as many other parts of Europe so I am partial to thin crusts and minimal toppings).<br><br>Oh, and to make a great experience even better, if you site on the right half of the restaurant, you get to watch Tony work his magic preparing the pizzas in the 900 degree wood oven!   I thoroughly enjoyed this portion of the whole experience.  Tony also periodically wanders out to chat with customers which I thought was nice.  I didn&#39;t get to meet him but maybe next time!", "reviewer_name": "Laura B.", "page": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/tonys-pizza-napoletana-san-francisco?osq=pizza"},

How much I wanted to love your offering... deep sigh.<br><br>Where to start? <br><br>We went to Tony&#39;s on a Saturday evening. Not the best decision, but I was huuungry for a pizza, and nothing but Tony&#39;s would do. The wait&#39;s 1.5 hours; but I&#39;ll gladly suffer, for Tony&#39;s da man.<br><br>After suffering through 84 minutes of sheer agony, we finally got our table. We were ready to order before our butts could even touch the chairs. <br><br>Tony&#39;s is famous for their pizza margherita; and that&#39;s what we&#39;d come to eat. Now Tony says that they make only 73 of them with the special San Felice flour per day; and by the time our butts were ensconced in those chairs, the special dough was long gone. But, that&#39;s our fault and you can&#39;t blame Tony for it. So we ordered the next best thing, the &#34;margherita extra&#34;, made with the not-so-special Caputo flour. And we also ordered another type of pizza, the &#34;original tomato pie&#34;, also known as the &#34;upside down pizza&#34; with cheeze under the sauce. And, for good measure, the stir-fried spinach with garlic as an appetizer.<br><br>Our upside-down pizza came first. It was quite good. The sauce was flavorful, the crust was medium and well done. We quickly dug into it with excitement (and overdue hunger). <br><br>Next came the Margherita Extra. Whoa... what a disappointment. Even though both pizzae(?) were supposed to be &#34;medium rustic crust&#34;, the M.E. was very thin crust. That, in itself, isn&#39;t a killer. The worst part was the sauce: it was absolutely flavorless! It was as if someone opened a can of tomato puree and just poured it on the pizza. There were no herbs or spices in the sauce; and it was thin and runny. And then, there were just 6 basil leaves on the entire pizza. Come on, you need more than just 6 paltry leaves! Anyways: the M.E. was a big disappointment. <br><br>One final insult: they forgot to bring the appetizer, and brought it after we&#39;d dug into the pizzas. I&#39;ll chalk that up to a busy night; but I&#39;m guessing, with all the hype, every night is probably a busy night for them.<br><br>All in all: I was disappointed. Given the crowds and the lack of parking in North Beach, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be back again.", "reviewer_name": "A J.", "page": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/tonys-pizza-napoletana-san-francisco?osq=pizza"},

My friends and I came here on a Friday night and it was 1.5 hours wait. Sounds long but the good thing is that after you put your name down, they take down your phone number as well so you can totally hit up a bar or something nearby and wait for the hostess to call you. Now that is customer service!<br><br>We got three pizzas between us and a bottle of wine. First we got the Prosciutto Pomodorini. Usually, I don&#39;t like arugula but on this pizza it was really good w/ the cherry tomatoes and prosciutto. Then the New Yorker and it was freaking AMAZING. really good italian sausage and the ricotta.. holy cow it is to die for. Super creamy and rich, takes pizza to a new level. Lastly we had the award winning Cal Italia. A white pizza that was also seriously to die for. The wine our waiter paired with our meal was also quite delish and complimented everything.<br><br>This is one of those places where you think to yourself &#39;Man I gotta try everything on the menu and just go down the list&#39; and that is exactly what I am going to do.

You simply order at the counter and your order comes out 15-20 minutes later (unless you order one of the slices already behind the counter.) The quail egg, white rose potato and guancale Californian style pizza comes highly recommended. <br><br>The ingredients include: mozzarella, white rose potatoes, rosemary, calabrese peppers, chorizo, quail eggs, guanciale (pork cheek), cowgirl creamery fromage blanc, lavender sea salt. The potatoes are thinly cut and offer a lovely unexpected crunch in the pizza. The cheese is creamy and provides a great burst of flavor. Oh and the quail eggs are soft-cooked and still runny on the inside--perfect for smearing over the rest of your pizza.<br><br>We also got the gigante meatball with marinara sauce. At $9 for a giant meatball, it&#39;s a little pricey, but definitely worth trying once. <br><br>Carry your selections outside to the little sidewalk deck with cute tiled tables for a lovely summer night meal.

Unfortunately, I don&#39;t live right in the city and can only come occasionally, but it&#39;s worth traveling for. It&#39;s a small, unpretentious place that always seems to have a line. Among other things, this means the pizza is always fresh from the oven. One of the main problems with average pizzerias is that you get stale slices that have been sitting around for a while. That never happens here. I generally prefer plain cheese, but they have a variety of other kinds as well, such as pesto, vegetable and various meat toppings. The only bad thing I can say about a place like this is that it makes ordinary pizza, which you get in most places around the country, harder to tolerate.

The place is always busy and rightfully so, but it&#39;s worth the wait. Here are some tips from my experience there. <br><br>If you have a party of 2-3 people, put your name on the table list when you arrive, but check the bar top every so often for open seats. The same full menu is available at the bar and more than likely you will be sitting down before your normal table would be ready. Also, the bartenders are very knowledgeable and personable so that makes the dining experience that much better. If you have a party of 4 or more, you will be waiting so don&#39;t be too mad when the hostess tells you it&#39;ll be an hour or two. <br><br>As far as pizza goes, I suggest ordering two pizzas from different menu sections and planning on taking home the leftovers.

We were greeted with a small storefront churning out some absolutely delicious slices!<br><br>THE EATS:<br>The group ordered just about everything they had, and it was all good, but I have to highlight two pizzas specifically.<br><br>1) California -- This pizza had meatball, garlic, ricotta, and Parmesan (beyond the pizza pie staples). The cheese was hot and stringy, giving you that sought-after commercial-style bite that really takes two or three to get it all. Ricotta gives this pizza a surprisingly sweet side, balancing out the salt in the mozzarella and meats.<br><br>2) Romana -- I&#39;d compare this pizza to a margherita pizza, as the main topping was tomato. But add some shredded basil and a sweet and tangy balsamic demi glacé drizzle, and you&#39;ll learn to love the spectacular balance of acid, sweet, and salty. So good!<br><br>THE VERDICT:<br>This was some of the best pizza I&#39;ve had. I&#39;m no connoisseur, but I do know good food when I come across it.

A simple marguerita served on a tin plate, with the pizza spilling off it, topped with gorgeous basil and olive oil. There are few meals that give such a simple and basic level of satisfaction.<br><br>I wouldn&#39;t say that Tony&#39;s quite hits that mark, but they aren&#39;t far off. In all fairness I made the mistake of ordering a rustic crust when what I really wanted was the classic Napoli crust, which is super thin. That being said, although what I did get wasn&#39;t quite what I wanted, it was very good. I also tried a slice of their quattro formaggio and one with fig on it. Those were both good, but I&#39;m a sucker for simplicity. <br><br>Next time, and there will definitely be a next time, I will order their classic Napoli marguerita and perhaps the rating will go from a 4 to a 5.", "reviewer_name": "Natasha Anna A.", "page": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/tonys-pizza-napoletana-san-francisco?osq=pizza"},

Gave us a run down of the different pizza&#39;s and how they are strategically arranged on the menu. Go for the &#34;T&#34; down the middle was my impression.<br><br>Bruschetta - Awesome. Heirloom tomatoes. Yum yum. How can you go wrong. Delicious. The plate was also nicely decorated by a frame of olive oil and basalmic vinegar drops.<br><br>Meat balls - Awesome. My only criticism is that they could have been a little hotter and maybe a bit of searing on the outside to aid a bit of crisp texture. Otherwise no complaints.<br><br>Magherita pizza - Gotta go for the Gold right! The porcelain tower plate was a nice touch. Fabulous. Delicious. I can see how others may not like it. The center part of the pizza (the tips of each slice) was soggy. And yes there is a bitterness to the crust. But that sogginess was actually pretty damn good because all the flavors are concentrated at the tip and the dough kinda mops up all the flavors. Besides on bite the tip is gone and you&#39;re on to the rest of the pizza with a perfectly crisp and dry crust. As for the bitterness, that&#39;s a taste preference. I personally like the bitterness. Dunno how to explain it except that I liked it. It&#39;s kinda like a dark chocolate vs. milk chocolate thing. <br><br>Well worth it. Gonna come back for the other pizza flavors next time. Can&#39;t wait. Good job Tony.", "reviewer_name": "Tom L.", "page": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/tonys-pizza-napoletana-san-francisco?osq=pizza"},

The Sicilian crust will do its best to absorb your Kamikaze shots. One thing I will say about this place is that the sauce was very flavorful.

Then we ordered the arugula and prosciutto pizza - REALLY good, though I thought the grease from the cheese spread onto the arugula, and that was a bit weird, like it wilted the greens a little bit.

Naturally, because I&#39;m from the &#34;Show-Me State,&#34; I was skeptical (yes, this review is about to get cheesy - NO PUN INTENDED, maybe). I&#39;ve been eating St Louis style pizza since I&#39;ve had teeth, so I think I&#39;m a pretty good judge of STL or not STL. I am NOT an Imo&#39;s fan, which is the McDonald&#39;s of STL pizza. I&#39;ll eat it if that&#39;s all I can get, but I&#39;m more of a Talayna&#39;s/Serra&#39;s kind of lady. Enough about me, let&#39;s get down to the pizza.<br><br>A+ for the tiny pepperoni<br>A+ for the provel cheese<br>B for the crust. I really loved that it was cut into tiny squares just like back home<br>C- for sauce. It&#39;s really too sweet. I read another review where they agreed. I hope that they change the sauce someday. It tasted better as a leftover, but still too sweet.<br><br>If you&#39;ve never had STL pizza before, tell your friend to get it and try some of theirs. I don&#39;t know many people who aren&#39;t from Missouri that actually enjoy STL pizza. I love it, but maybe it&#39;s an acquired taste? Something about the cheese. Provel is a very melty blend of cheddar, Swiss and provolone. <br><br>Anyway, I will definitely go back to Tony&#39;s. I do hope that they improve their STL sauce, but there are so many other kinds of pizzas to try. I can&#39;t wait to go back.<br><br>Five stars for the great staff. <br><br>One tip: If you&#39;re driving, don&#39;t forget to bring quarters.

Service 1 star. i would have given this place 5 stars had it not been for the poor attitude of one of the young girls that took the orders. the pizza itself is great. i had actually come here once before and it was closed and so on my next trip to san fran i vowed to go back. i asked the young lady if they had pepperoni and sausage together on one pizza and she said that they were separate and the only one that came with both meats together was a combo pizza with mushrooms and other stuff. so my friend ordered the combo and i said i just wanted the pepperoni for myself. so they brought out a sausage and we were confused as to why they did that and the order taker comes over and says that i ordered the sausage AND the pepperoni, which i did not as i told her that. instead of just saying ok and preparing a pepperoni pizza, she proceeds to tell me that she can make me a pepperoni pizza but she has to charge me for the sausage one too. SORRY that&#39;s when this place failed epically. Whether she heard wrong or got things confused or whatever, she should have just said ok, no problem, it will be 5 or 10 minutes for the pepperoni and that would have been fine. But no, after i told her i WAS NOT going to pay for something i didn&#39;t order, she clearly was frustrated, had an attitude and snatched the sausage pizza from the counter and throws it away in a trashcan in front of me with an attitude and says something like &#34;fine&#34; and says she will make the pepperoni one. i told her she could save the attitude as it was uncalled for. i will never come back to this place. the pizza is great but i did not appreciate that. i just wanted what i ordered. if she got the order wrong, no problem. fix it and move on but dont argue with customers. never coming back.", "reviewer_name": "Food C.", "page": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/golden-boy-pizza-san-francisco?osq=pizza"},

The pie is huge, rectangular, and comes out on a board. <br><br>There are three variations, each divided into three sections with different toppings (&#34;no substitutions&#34;), so it&#39;s sort of like getting three small pizzas. Two of the triple combos had one dessertish section (Gorgonzola with sweet figs and balsamic reduction or with dates, pecans, apples, and honey), which didn&#39;t sound appealing, so we got the third, which had all savory combos. Pepperoni a bit greasy a la New York &#34;Ray&#39;s&#34; style with oil dripping down my wrist, pesto with goat cheese was rich and creamy, ricotta with big slices of fleshy sweet-hot red peppers and linguisa was something new to me. All were pretty good, albeit a bit greasy or juicy, so messy to eat.<br><br>The crust was very thin but didn&#39;t get soggy. Presumably it was inspired by the famous focaccia / pizza bianca at Forno Campi de&#39; Fiori, and the toppings were loosely inspired by Rome&#39;s pizza a taglio aka pizza rustica shops. I doubt there&#39;s anything like this in Rome.<br><br>The menu says a Piccola ($32) &#34;serves 2-3,&#34; but I estimate it was roughly 12&#34; x 27&#34; (about as much pizza as a 20&#34; round pie), so two people would have to have huge appetites to polish one off.

My friend is Italian, and he was visiting San Francisco for the first time in his life. He had never eaten at Golden Boy Pizza. After my friend had finished eating his slice of pizza, he told me that it was excellent. Sometimes, lines of up to 15-30 people form at the front door, especially during the evening on Fridays and Saturdays anywhere from around 6PM to after midnight. However, on those occasions when there is a line, it moves quickly. The service is fast. Obviously, all of those people think that the wait of a few minutes to eat Golden Boy pizza is worth the time. Golden Boy serves a whole lot of pizza. It is always fresh. The freshly baked pizza goes from the oven to the front display case. When a customer places an order at the front register, one of the staff places the pizza in the microwave to heat it up to maximum palatable temperature.

Within about 25 minutes we had our pie, and it was the best thin-crust pizza I&#39;ve had outside of NY state. The crust was heavenly -- and much better than the crust on Tony&#39;s Pysano&#39;s pizzas. It was blissfully blistered and charred, not too dry. <br><br>The tomato sauce appears to be fresh and hand-crushed. The sausage and pepperoni appeared to be handcrafted as well, and the spicy bite of the pepperoni was nicely tempered by generous dollups of ricotta. <br><br>They sell Mexican Cokes (yay!) but no beer (boo). <br><br>Small nit: there is no menu posted, and not until we got to the order-taker that we could see the extensive menu. I&#39;d looked at the menu online ahead of time, but if I hadn&#39;t, I&#39;d have been a little peeved about that... I need to mull over my choices then arm-wrestle my hubby over what to get.

Parking is tough (they&#39;re right on Washington Square), so plan accordingly. <br><br>Also, although the sidewalk tables look inviting, unless you get the seats next to the building, they are on a deceptively slanty sidewalk - sitting is awkward - and you are about an inch and a half from the street and exhaust-belching tour buses.

The cream sauce poured on top was delicious but I can tell that the marinara sauce by itself was what made this dish. Next we had the pesto linguine. Very good as well. We had the New Yorker pizza on the Detroit crust. It was a huge slice with dough similar to a focaccia. Very large and a little hard to eat.

The Margherita Pizza was selected because of the awards and reviews- you could tell the ingredients were fresh, quality, and well cooked. It was very tasty! The only catch, was lack of substance... but it&#39;s a Margherita Pizza so that should be expected. The tartufo Pizza was a hit as it came with a good amount of quantity and quality ingredients.

This pizza was wonderfully flavorful. I don&#39;t even like mushrooms, but the use of the non-garden variety made it much more palatable, as well as the creamy cheeses. <br><br>My second fave was the Cal Italia more for it&#39;s unique combination of flavors - the savory of the prosciutto, the strong melding of asiago, mozzarella, and gorgonzola cheeses, sweetness from the fig preserve drizzled all around, and some balsamic for tangy-ness.

I didn&#39;t try the appetizer, but from the sounds that my dinner companions made, it was safe to say that they found it delicious.<br><br>After a 15, 20 minute wait, the waitress showed us to our table. The table decided on the Margherita and Cal Italia pizzas (both award winners, whatever that means) and the Swiss chard to start. <br><br>The Swiss chard was a warm salad (sauteed dirty girl farms swiss chard, Iacopi farm white gigante beans, pork chorizo) and packed quite the punch from the chorizo.

I highly recommend it.<br><br>The Margherita (dough mixed by hand using san felice flour then <br>proofed in neapolitan wood boxes, san marzano tomatoes dop, sea salt, mozzarella fior di latte, fresh basil, extra virgin olive oil ) is what Tony&#39;s is known for. They only make 73 per day. Thankfully, we didn&#39;t have to push any old ladies down the stairs to get our mitts on one. Maybe it was the high expectations, but it was rather anticlimatic. The crust was a bit soggy from the sauce and droopy. The ingredients all tasted fresh but I just didn&#39;t get all the fuss was about.<br><br>The Cal Italia (asiago,  mozzarella, imported italian gorgonzola, sweet fig preserve from Croatia, prosciutto di parma, parmigiano, balsamic), now that was up there with the best pizza that I&#39;ve ever had (Cheeseboard at Berkeley is still #1 though). The dough was crispy on the bottom and chewy on the sides. The proscuitto wasn&#39;t dry or burnt and simply melted in my mouth. The kicker though, was the fig preserve and balsamic drizzle (my nizzle). That sweet and savory punch was so creative and totally did it for me. Everyone at the table were blown away.<br><br>Tony&#39;s definitely take pizza making seriously.

Though not as great as their Margherita pizzas, the Cholula is much more meaty with an emphasis on spicy. They use jalapeno peppers to give it a kick. The hot sauce blended with the cheese works wonders on the taste buds and works nicely with the chicken and chorizo bits. <br><br>Our waitress was very very cheerful -- almost as if she had too much coffee.

So the crust I wasn&#39;t that much of a fan of, had a whole slew of pizza from NY to woodfire to coalfire, and while each one was scrumptious, the crust just doesn&#39;t do it. I&#39;ve said it once, and I&#39;ll say it again, it&#39;s something about west coast pizza where the crust ends up soggy in the middle, I don&#39;t know why. Like the pizza is GREAT, but when I pick up a slice, the tip always falls forward then the toppings slides off. <br><br>Regardless I still give 4 stars. Wait is long, yes get over it, but pizza comes out fast and fresh. My favorite of the night is between this spicy chorizo and potato pizza and the thin crust, mozarella and sausage pizza. The first one because there was this amazing creamy cheese that they dolloped randomly, and as you bit into the spicy chorizo and peppers, the cheese would cool your mouth off. Loved it! The thin crust because of the sauce, the sweet tomato sauce which was the best sauce ever! I didn&#39;t even care for the sausage, I just picked it off. Loved the tomato sauce!

Their pizzas are on the pricier side, but to me it is quality over quantity. The wait is a bit long, so next time if I return I would probably plan to come a little earlier before the dinner rush. Supposedly their meatballs are good (based on many orders we saw tables get), so that&#39;s something we may have to try next time.

I ordered the award-winning margherita pizza both times I visited. The sauce is tasty, with a pure San Marzano flavor, and the crust is simultaneously crisp and chewy, but the char really gets in the way of the flavor. I felt like I couldn&#39;t taste the base flavors of the pizza over the burnt dough, even if it&#39;s more authentic that way. The pizza is also pretty small, enough to feed one hungry person.<br><br>$19 + tax and tip is quite a lot of money, and I&#39;d rather spend it elsewhere. The margherita pizza at Emilia&#39;s Pizzeria in Berkeley is cheaper, larger, and in my opinion, tastier.<br><br>(That&#39;s not to say I don&#39;t admire the incredible craftsmanship that goes into making these pizzas. Imported ingredients! Four ovens! I hope this place continues to thrive.)", "reviewer_name": "Alexei B.", "page": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/tonys-pizza-napoletana-san-francisco?osq=pizza"},

After reading all of the reviews I bought into the &#34;hype&#34;! Went there on 9/2/17 tried to get a table for 2. There was an hour and 45 minute wait. That&#39;s fine I don&#39;t mind waiting for good food. We waited and had a slice of pizza next door. (Not a bad slice)! <br><br>We finally got a table and they said there wasn&#39;t any wood fired pizza because of the heat wave. Ok, I understand... it gets hot in the kitchen during a heat wave. So we had to change our order to a &#34;Sweet Grandma pie&#34;. After waiting for 20 minutes, the waitress came back and said they didn&#39;t have anymore of the sweet grandma pie either. We then ordered the &#34;classic New York&#34; pie. Everyone around us, who was seated after us, got their food before us. Our order must have got put to the back of the line, again! The drunk guy next to us dropped an entire pie on my wife&#39;s feet. His girlfriend had her foot on the table, and was showing  the rest of their table, her bunions. Gross! (Look at the surveillance camera). However, after all of this, I&#39;m still not upset! It&#39;s a Saturday night in San Francisco! You have to expect stuff like this to happen when you go out. Moving on... <br><br>We ended up waiting an hour for our &#34;New York Pie&#34;. After already waiting 1 hour and 45 mins to be seated. (All of this for some pizza! I&#39;m expecting this pie to be delicious). Which being from the NYC/NJ area, I can say that this pie was a disgrace to New York Pizza and Pizza in general!The dough was ehhh, it lacked cheese and the sauce?!... Gross!! Like sweet tomato paste! It was a very sweet pasty sauce, sort of tangy. This was unlike any New York pizza I&#39;ve had. Even if they didn&#39;t call it a New York Pizza, I still would have hated it! I&#39;ve had a million slices of pizza in my life. I know pizza. This Pizza was on the same playing field as a quality frozen pizza, or pizza from a national pizza chain. Not the quality that you would expect from a local Italian restaurant/pizzeria! I hate to be so harsh on a local business. The only positive thing that I will say is that the waitress gave us an order of meatballs on the house because we waited so long for our food. The meatballs were good. She was great! Everything was out of her control. Everything from the food to the dining experience was terrible! The place even smelled like a dirty bar.

However, the last couple times the service has been awful. At the slice to go side, the girl(s) that work there have snapped at me for not hearing my number being called from outside. It gets crowded and hectic in that part of the restaurant, I get it, but there&#39;s no need to yell at a loyal customer for not being able to hear your order being called. Further, the food quality here is not as great as the actual sit down spot.<br>So, the next day I decide to give the sit down spot a go before I left San Francisco. The waits are always long, I get that too; the hostesses can definitely try to smile and be a little more pleasant and welcoming. When we finally sat down, we got seating outside and were ignored for over 20 minutes. This is unacceptable, considering I counted 3 busboys and the manager walk by before our server ever came to us.

Their mix of multiple styles of pizza cooked in different ovens is unmatched in the city, and perhaps well beyond in the surrounding areas.  Not to distract you from the great pizzas, but the salads, appetizers, and desserts are all great as well- a Caesar to start and an Affogato to finish are always worth considering! <br><br>The wood-burning oven pizzas are the &#39;creme de la creme&#39; of Tony&#39;s- so don&#39;t get distracted by the other 6-7 styles offered!  Most of the other pizzas styles are great- but the wood-burning oven pizzas are the real deal.  My personal favorite is the &#39;New Yorker&#39;- however I&#39;m not sure if this is offered in the wood-burning oven any more?- on my last visit it was offered as one of his coal-fired pizzas, and it was delicious as well.  The wood-fired margherita pizza is Tony&#39;s &#39;legend&#39;- he has won awards for this and I&#39;d say I see him there making them himself 4 out of 5 times that I visit.  The slice house is excellent for what it is as well, but don&#39;t confuse the two- they are different creatures serving different purposes and NOT serving the same pizzas.  <br><br>Be aware that Tony&#39;s Napoletana can be complicated to get into - almost always very busy - and closed on Mondays/Tuesdays.  *Hint- you can get pizza at the bar if you see an open spot.  Sometimes lunch is your best bet to avoid a wait- but sometimes there are lines of people waiting before their opening.  Be persistent and don&#39;t give up!  Many do- and go to the Slice house instead and are less impressed with their experience as they have not dined on the full pizza-power of Tony.<br><br>Do yourself a favor and try Tony&#39;s- their pizzas are also available for take-out and I have heard they have a limited delivery radius as well.  But the pizza will not be the same unless presented straight out of the oven on to your table.  The only other pizzas in SF in the same conversation as Tony&#39;s Napoletana&#39;s wood-fired pizzas are those found at Una Pizza Napoletana, A16, and Flour+Water.  And thats it!<br>I&#39;m already looking forward to my next visit!", "reviewer_name": "Andy S.", "page": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/tonys-pizza-napoletana-san-francisco?osq=pizza"},

We had the Sam Lorenzo, New Jersey style pizza. The spinach salad was just ok, kinda skimped on the goat cheese and pecans, but passable.

The delivery person was apologetic and gracious, so I wasn&#39;t upset about the wait.  What I didn&#39;t care for was the fact that both items were delivered cold and had to be heated before we could try to enjoy them.  Hmm, maybe a motorized delivery vehicle would make it easier to deliver the food hot.<br><br>As for the food, it was just OK.
