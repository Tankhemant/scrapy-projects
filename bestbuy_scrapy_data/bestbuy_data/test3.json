        "comment": "This device works pretty good as long as it's up your butt or in your shirt pocket. No range at all. I was 20 ft away from this device in another room and could not connect to it. The same issue for other family members in other rooms of the house. Kept it for a couple of days to give it a fair chance. The limited range of this device is very poor. I imagine you could connect 10 devices to this, if it were five people holding two devices standing shoulder to shoulder in a circle!\nI know now why they charged me a $45 restocking Fee, because many people are trying to return them. The almost 40% restocking cost is to deter you to even return it.",

This will cost way more to run.. for example $6 per GB\nWorks great for checking email and internet sleuthing. \nThe battery power depends on usage but for now I can probably get 10-12 hours of battery power.\nCustomer service has been helpful.\n I reached out through the online chat messenger\n and got help within minutes.\nThere was some trouble shooting and resetting that came up but they walk you through it .\n.",

It is easy to set up using the Solis App. I use the pay-per-day option for data so that I am only paying when I need to use it. It saves me money when I travel internationally too. I no longer need to purchase my cell service's international travel plan. The Solis connect up to 10 devices so in addition to my laptop I use it with my phone and then use WiFi calling. It is so light and portable I just stick in my bag or back pocket.",

        "comment": "I bought the Solis Lite with expectations that were pretty tragic. I expected the quality to be about cell phone wifi hot spot level, which I hadn't realize was so lousy until I tried to actually stream music through it. The Solis Lite came into my life and legitimately I was blown away by how great it functions. I've had zero connectivity issues in western Massachusetts, USA, and the speed has been greater than I had hoped, and stable. I've recommended this product to a few of my friends who are now probably sick of me raving about it. Thank you, Skyroam, for making such a great little device and providing this service!",

We were able to use it in all the ports on our Panama Canal cruise from Vancouver to Fort Lauderdale. We could even do Facebook updates all the way through the canal. Fantastic! No more looking for free wifi after leaving the ship. When at home or traveling, I take it with me when hiking or even when doing chores around town. Wifi is always with me in my car. I can’t say enough about Customer Service. They are awesome! I’ve demonstrated how easy to use this device is multiple times. I should get a commission! Great Product!",

I was really happy with the new smaller design however the device and service has really let me down.\nI have only used the unit 3 times since I purchased it once in Bucharest once in Warsaw where I simply could not connect to the service. This was poor but I have had trouble connecting other devices in those countries \nBut the biggest failure was in HK where I connected really easy but the Unlimited day Pass was so slow after the first 30 mins it was unusable. I was tempted to purchase unlimited monthly passes but I’m so worried that the service will be so slow it will not be worth it.\n\nMassive disappointment, Can I return It?",

The service continues to be extremely unreliable despite people around me being able to connect to and use the cellular network for the same activities (and more) than what I am trying to use it for. Support was working for a bit, but now my chat with support refuses to work whenever I don’t have WiFi for calls (even though I have enough WiFi to stream music). I emailed support via the website yesterday to express my frustration problems and have yet to hear from anyone. Please do yourself a favor and look at other products.",

Once it connected it worked fine and did what it is suppose to do. Worked with their customer support on live chat and first he said it wouldnt work in a Verizon area and then few minutes later said it should still connect to any tower. He said he reset something on his end and said to power down and wait. Still didnt help. Tried mutiple times. Dont try their emal. They say they can help then tell you to use live chat after a couple emails. I selected yes for would I recommend but it depends where you live.",

I have to shut down my PC, shut down the wifi device and reboot. \n\nIf I had not been forced to switch from Solis 1 to solis Lite 5g, I wouldn't be using Solis Lite.\n\nThe service is not stable.",

Within two hours of running this little devil my room smells great, and I can take deep easy breaths in with no raspy feeling that dusty and pollen gives me. Being that I have a small canine the room also always has a smell of dog. Right now my room smells like fresh air you get a whiff of on the way to the ocean, before the salt, but in between the city smog and the clean breeze of the coast. Very small and light weight. I think my favorite part is there is no superfluous options, though I&#39;d of enjoyed having a timer to set it so it would turn off after an hour of being out of the house.",

I put a digital thermometer/humidity meter in the car with the dehumidifier running. After a day 2 cups of water were pulled out of the air in the vehicle. I emptied it a few more times with less water each day over a week and now the humidity is down to a level where mold will not grow. It would also be great for a gun safe since it is quite small but does pull a remarkable amount of moisture from the air for it&#39;s size. I&#39;m not sure how well it would work for a whole room since I only used it in a small space but my experience so far has been positive.",

I work grave shifts at my job, and I prefer to have a more natural sounding white noise other than what a smart phone app can provide while I&#39;m sleeping during the day. It actually wasn&#39;t as loud as I was hoping. I ended up switching it out for the one in my daughter&#39;s room, and it seems to work great! It seems to work well in the amount of space, is easy to use, and makes enough noise to be her sound machine without being overwhelming during the night. If you are looking for one that is completely silent, however, this maybe isn&#39;t the one for you.",

In other words, if relative humidity outside is 60%, the lowest this unit will bring RH in a room is about 55%. If you plan to use it in a room with a draft, or any room bigger than a small bedroom, you will want a bigger /faster drying unit.",

        "comment": "This is a great little unit! I moved into a 2 bedroom apartment that was so humid it was uncomfortable. I didn&#39;t want to spend a ton of money or get a large dehumidifier due to limited space and because winter will be here soon so I thought I would give this one a try and would pass it on to my brother for use in his RV if my place was too big for it to handle. I knew it wasn&#39;t really built to handle an entire apartment so I wasn&#39;t expecting it to be perfect but it has made a measurable improvement and is the perfect size for my needs. It&#39;s super quiet and reliably shuts itself off when full which was also important to me. Rather than buying a large unit I would recommend starting with one of these and adding a second one later if one isn&#39;t enough.",

        "comment": "I have both the KardiaMobile (Single-Lead) and KardiaMobile 6L (6-Lead).  I keep the 6L at home and the KardiaMobile in my desk at work.  Both devices give me the same nature of results; I can't tell whether the 6L is more accurate or more sensitive, they both seem to detect the same kinds of irrythmias.  The KardiaMobile is easy to use at work, it just takes a few seconds, using two fingers, at your desk.  The KardiaMobile came with a felt carrying case with magnetic closure, included in the box.  At first I didn't quite understand how the KardiaMobile works, it doesn't use bluetooth it uses some sort of high frequency audio to communicate with your cellphone app.  So your cellphone has to be nearby and the microphone can't be hidden from the KardiaMobile, they have to be fairly close to each other and sort of pointing at each other, then they can communicate just fine. I find the real-time results so useful to understand what's going on.  This is so much more valuable than an annual check-up or a one-day Holter Test.",

        "comment": "The Kardia Mobile Single is a fantastic idea.  Setup was easy and the instructions are easy.  Unfortunately using the pads has been extremely difficult to get a good reading.  I've tried several times over the week that I've had it and still did not get a stable graft.  My first try told me to move because of interference.  I wasn't anywhere near any other electronics or transformers.  My next try in the same location worked, but the graft was all over the place.  Tried all the suggestions given by the company online and have yet to get a clean graft.  The quality of the device is good, but you have to pay extra if you want a carrying case.",

        "comment": "As a former AFib sufferer, this device has proven to be an invaluable tool for monitoring and detecting both normal and irregular heart rhythms.  The associated Kardia iPhone app records measurement results locally which enables the information to be conveniently presented to your cardiologist or GP during routine visits.  An optional subscription facilitates storing of the EKG measurements in the cloud.  The only criticism, in terms of usage, is that a firm/heavy pressure must be applied and maintained to the electrodes during the 60 second measurement period.  Placing the device on a table or firm surface is mandatory to avoid miss-reads.",

        "comment": "Product is a great idea, but the electrode piece is too small to comfortably just sit and place your fingers on, and too easily moved to interfere with getting a good ekg. I have a prosthetic aortic valve and I’ve yet to get a good ekg from it since purchase. All I get is that my readings have too much electrical interference no matter where I sit to do\nThis. The idea was to purchase this device and use it to create EKGs and send them to my cardiologist on a weekly basis, but with no readable ekgs that all went out the window. My advice is stay away from this device until they improve the size and stability of the electrode piece of the equipment.",

He said...\n\n\"Ok...  relax your arms to get a clean strip and TEXT it to me...\"   Don't come to the office, don't go to the ER, just relax your arms, get and clean reading and TEXT it to me....

It is extremely light and easy to travel with...I am in public safety and am constantly needing to be near a computer but also in the field at the same time...this thing solved that for me! I can now just scan documents right to my phone or to the cloud and keep it moving! The setup was extremely easy.... pretty much plug and play..only needed to download a couple things from the links listed in the instruction manual....simple and was working within 5 minutes from first opening the box! The scan quality has been decent enough so far...it's not high def quality but way better than I even expected from a portable scanner. Only cons I have discovered so far is the scanner is so light that it feels really cheap....I don't have any doubt that if I were to accidentally drop it or even just have it in a backpack without a protective case....this thing would crush and break VERY easily. But I somewhat expected that in a portable scanner. This is a review for the RapidReceipt RR-60 Mobile Receipt Scanner that I received free of charge to do a beta test and review!",

        "comment": "The Epson Rapid Receipt RR-60 is an exceptionally good receipt and document scanner.  It is a small, fast, lightweight, and portable scanner designed for managing receipts/invoices.  It can scan receipts, business cards, and PDF documents fast and effortlessly.  Setup and installation were completed within minutes.  I just attached the USB cable to scanner and my Surface Pro and downloaded the necessary software and drivers from the Epson website.  The instructions were quite simple to follow.  I am able scan documents and categorize them into applicable folders in a specified location.  I have saved in Google drive, my documents’ folder on my computer and even emailed a few documents using the software.  Scanned items can be saved or exported.  This scanner has made storing my personal documents especially old tax return information a breeze.  Gone are days of storing piles of receipts and documents.  It is a very efficient scanner, and I am very pleased with its capabilities.  So far, I have no complaints.  I would really recommend it for anyone needing to organize paperwork whether personal or business.

I upload a lot of receipts and documents daily and would have to use my bulky printer to scan then upload into my email and send to appropriate receiver. Lots of times they were everywhere in my email, leaving me spending unnecessary times locating them. This little handy scanner does it all in a matter of seconds and neatly files them all in one place. I’m not sure how I’ve survived all this time without this scanner. I’m so thankful to of had the opportunity to receive this scanner to test. “This is a review for the RapidReceipt RR-60 Mobile Receipt Scanner that I received free of charge to do a beta test and review.”",

This little scanner is extremely light, and it's small enough to fit into a backpack. Another useful feature of this awesome scanner is it doesn't need an external power source for the power, so you don't need to carry a power adapter and worry about finding an electrical outlet to plug it into. It gets its power from the USB cord, so there is no need for a power adapter. \n\nThe scanner is fast at scanning; it takes only about 5-6 seconds to scan a full page. The receipts are just as fast depending on how long of a receipt your scanning. If you have many receipts or a need for a portable scanning option, this is the scanner right for the job. The biggest plus for me is the lightweight, portable scanner I can take anywhere with me without the need for a power adapter.\n\n“This is a review for the RapidReceipt RR-60 Mobile Receipt Scanner that I received free",

Put your documents right in the scanner and push scan. Very simple to use. I also like that it comes with a software that can easily access where you do your taxes and upload documents to your tax software, that is so cool. It's nicely made, and it is not big, doesn't take up alot of space. Even scans in color, perfect for your everyday scanning! I would definitely recommend this thing is very perfect and useful! .",

        "comment": "I'm reviewing the Epson RR-60 Rapid Receipt Portable Scanner. Wow, I've been looking for a portable scanner to take with me to school and work, and I found one. This little scanner is extremely light, and it's small enough to fit into a backpack. Another useful feature of this awesome scanner is it doesn't need an external power source for the power, so you don't need to carry a power adapter and worry about finding an electrical outlet to plug it into. It gets its power from the USB cord, so there is no need for a power adapter. \r\n\r\nThe scanner is fast at scanning; it takes only about 5-6 seconds to scan a full page. The receipts are just as fast depending on how long of a receipt your scanning. If you have many receipts or a need for a portable scanning option, this is the scanner right for the job. The biggest plus for me is the lightweight, portable scanner I can take anywhere with me without the need for a power adapter.\r\n\r\n“This is a review for the RapidReceipt RR-60 Mobile Receipt Scanner that I received free of charge to do a beta test and review.”",

        "comment": "Difficult to find a good retractable iPhone holder/stand but the Joby TelePod (Model: JB01550) does the job. I needed something quick and found, for the price, it is a good value: lightweight and sturdy. I do recommend that if using as a stand, attach it to a 2.5 lb or more shot bag to prevent a strong wind from knocking it over. Currently, I use the JOBY TelePod to hold my Logitech - 4K Pro 4096 x 2160 Webcam (also purchased at Best Buy). As for the remote it does NOT stay attached to the handle at all, so I highly recommend you get a separate keychain ring and make it detachable. That way you can put in your pocket for remote picture and or video control. The holder clip for the phone is a pressure clamp and is okay. Not great and definitely not action shooting grade. If you want something for that, I recommend getting a Bower WA-TM100 360° Rotating Smartphone Tripod Mount – always good to have in your gear bag.",

The gripping mechanism is extremely cheap and low quality. The \"telescoping\" rod retracts under the slightest pressure. I should have bought the $25 one if I wanted something this cut-rate and pathetic.",

I bought this mostly for pictures, but is has scanned documents, racing bibs and pictures with excellent color reproduction.\n\nI did install the software that was recommended, but technically I could have used the built in one for My MacBook Pro, but I’m glad I used the other one. It makes it easy to add additional pages to the same document. Overall, I would totally buy this again. It can’t do two sides at the same time, but that is not a big deal considering pictures were the primary reason. I wanted this scanner.",

I used this scanner to digitize my family's photo albums so that we had a digital archive that can be accessed anywhere. The quality is high enough that if I wanted to reprint any of these photos, there would not be a significant loss of quality. And the file sizes are not storage limit destroyers for wherever you choose to store the digital files. \n\nOnce you get into a flow, the scanning process goes relatively quickly. The scanner does jam frequently but because of the size, all you have to do is pop it open and try again. If you don't rush it, it won't jam.",

Allows setup of multiple workflows for one-click scanning in a variety of formats - text, pdf, jpeg, etc. Also has a customizable machine default workflow so you can do quick scans with a press of the start button on the scanner. I use this scanner for receipts - they feed through easily and quickly, and set at the default 300 dpi the scans are quick and the images are sharp. This scanner is not wireless so it has to be connected to a laptop or desktop PC to work. The scanner is compact and lightweight so you could pack it in a bag with a laptop for on-the-go scanning, but the Brother wireless scanner for about $60 more might be a better choice if you need one for use on-the-road.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Brother DS-640 Compact Mobile Document Scanner \r\nBrother’s printer and scanner products never disappoint me. They seem to outlast my other equipment and work reliably. And, so again, I’m enjoying a portable scanner that was up and running only minutes after plugging it in and installing some software. No excuses, no problems. \r\n\r\nSETUP/INSTALL: Download the software. There are a couple of choices, and either works fine. There was a firmware update available, and that took moments to install, too. Plug in the printer and open the APP. You can select your Resolution (up to 600 x 600), File Type, color or B&W, size, and destination. Under advanced settings you can change brightness and contrast. Scanning is initiated from the App. Place the to-be-printed photo, paper, sketch into the front slot of the scanner, and initiate scanning from the APP. There is no auto-document feeder. While the scan is accomplished the image pops up in the App on your screen. \r\n\r\nPERFORMANCE: The scans are colorful, detailed and fast. Your selection of file type will determine what you will use to edit or enhance your scans (I use either Photo or Photoshop Elements --- NOT included). It’s all very straight forward. It’s hard to find fault with the scanner at all. It just works. \r\n\r\nI will remind other buyers that you should be sure you want a manual scanner. Brother has an autofeed version. It also has scanners that work with mobile devices. This model is intended to plug into the USB port of your laptop/desktop. I scan old photos and my grandkids artwork. I don’t care about auto-feed. My only “wish for” is that a nice carry case be included in the box. These wonderfully portable devices are not so portable if there is no protective carry case/shell/bag. \r\n\r\nBut, I still like it a lot. It's easy to recommend Brother’s DS-640 scanner.",

        "comment": "Bought it to put in the laundry room because the layout of our home meant that that room just happened to be the only other logical place we could stick a spare litter box. Problem is, the laundry room is connected to the kitchen and who wants to EVER smell litter box odor in their kitchen?? Problem solved! And as an added bonus, the kitchen itself even seems fresher. Kudos to this little machine for working even harder then we asked it to! Super easy to set up, very quiet, long cord, looks nice and above all else-- IT WORKS!  Will be buying another for our bathroom soon!",

Along with trying out some new medicine per his doctor, we bought this because I've heard that they help a great deal for people with allergies. It's been two months now, and things are going very well. He has minimal allergy issues, but cats aren't his only allergy. While there are many factors involved here, I feel that this purifier has helped greatly.",

We had been having problems in that room with litter box odors and that gross feeling of inhaling the dust from the litter and read that an air purifier might help with those problems. After just a day, the JS FLO air purifier has made a huge difference! It actually smells fresh in our office again and we don&#39;t feel the need to constantly have our windows open.  One thing to note: the device is a bit bigger than I was expecting. It is about as big around as a desktop PC tower, but isn&#39;t as long. This wasn&#39;t a huge deal for us because we were just planning on putting it in the corner anyway.   All in all, we&#39;re very happy with it!",

        "comment": "We moved into and apartment and our next door neighbor smokes. I have asthma and my husband or I neither one can stand the smell of smoke. We don&#39;t care if people smoke, we would just rather not have it in our home. We have tried plug-ins, wax warmers which would help some, but it was still very noticeable at times. We love our apartment and didn&#39;t want to move, so we decided from the reviews to try th JS FLO Purifier. What a blessing? We plugged it in and put it in what we thought was the problem area and from day one we have been smoke-smell free. We keep it on fan speed 2 and if we smell a hint of smoke we crank it up to 3 and the air is cleared up almost instantly. It is quiet, the perfect size and affordable. So glad we made the purchase!",

I&#39;m impressed by this unit and it&#39;s perfect for my studio apartment.   Please note-- I didn&#39;t realize that air purifiers (at least ones that really work!) do dry out the air. It&#39;s inevitable. I&#39;ll likely buy a small humidifier to try to counteract that, but in the meantime the subtle cat odors are gone and I recommend this item to anyone.",

So I thought I would try an air purifier.  I loved the look of this product so i bought one.  It took a few hours (high ceilings) but it did clear out the smoke. Because of its size, I move it from room to room with me throughout my day. I am looking forward to seeing how it helps with my allergies in the coming months but I have high hopes.",

Granted my wife and I do not have the biggest bedroom this little air purifier works so well we both sleep better and breath better. the first 3 nights with this thing were great and they only get better. The little green light is pretty cool.  Level 1 - Very quiet does a good job Level 2 - Normal noise level for one of these Level 3 - You can definitely hear this thing going. (Probably couldn&#39;t sleep with it on 3 unless you like a noticeable white noise)",

When I walk in my house, I smell nothing, and that's how I know it's working! There's no more dog smell or even stale air, unopened window smell. Just nothing...and I absolutely love it! We have an 85 lb lab mix. We love her, but our house was beginning to have that doggy smell that is hard to escape when you have a pet. It's gone and I'm a happy woman!",

There is a learning curve, I recommend watching some YouTube tutorials about how to use the different modes. Also get a monopod and you can really do some amazing shots!!! I only returned mine because I have a Pixel 6 and the volume buttons are to low on the side/almost centered. That is a Pixel design flaw because all clamp phone accessories to be balanced smash the buttons down. Do to Google's flaw of button placement the clamp had to be placed lower causing the phone to be unbalanced. My older Samsung Phones worked perfectly fine with the gimbal.Will repurchase another one when I get new phone with normal button placement.",

I originally wanted to get the OM6 but realized I'm not a pro, nor a consistent video maker so the OM SE fit my criteria. The benefit is that it has some features from the OM6 such as the active track 5.0 and some physical buttons on the gimbal itself. Only gripe is that the gimbal cannot go a full degree of motion on certain angles but that seems to be the case for most gimbals anyways in this price range.",

(The K317 - and the K360 keyboard - still work perfectly on every other device.)\n\nThis mouse has a constant, solid, dependable Bluetooth connection.  It is roughly the same size as the Logitech K317 which is itself about the right size for a normal-sized hand.  I prefer this mouse to the Logitech because it's less slippery on the sides and the scroll wheel.\n\nI might have to buy a few of these to connect to my other machines.",

        "comment": "Good mouse so far.  Compact, tracks nicely, has the tilt wheel for horizontal scrolling.  Up and running quickly.  Doesn't have the extra buttons on the side that quite a few mice have, but I don't really ever use those anyway.  Wheel and buttons are a little noisier than some other mice.  Like that it's bluetooth so don't have to mess with a dongle.  Comfortable in hand.  Only uses a single AA - have yet to see if its life is consistent with product claims.  At $20, it's a bit more than the no-name bluetooth mouse I'd purchased several years ago that only recently has been losing its connection - I think I paid about $10 for that one.  Guess the extra $10 is for Bill.",

        "comment": "Pro: I picked this mouse primarily for its Bluetooth 3.0 capability. There's no need for an extra dongle. My Surface Pro 3 picked up its signal right away. So pairing was easy. Using it is pretty comfortable. I have big hands, so using a smaller than usual mouse is not easy. Which brings up to my last point...\r\n\r\nCon: If your looking for a compact, travel mouse, this might not be for you. I still take it everywhere, but it's not compact at all.\r\n\r\nOverall: There's really nothing I can say about it that's bad. So far, I don't have any issues. It's just a users preference when and how to use it. It's a good buy.",

        "comment": "I bought this mouse just over a month ago to go with my Lenovo laptop (with only 2 USB ports). It makes a really nice travel mouse (compact in size and no cords, connectors, or plug-ins to fool with), and it works great, in general, with very good resolution, but it doesn't work on glass, and sometimes it seems a little slow to respond on a non-solid surface (e.g. loose cloth). On a solid surface (like a desktop, tabletop, or tight fabric), absolutely no problems. \r\n\r\nP.S. Just make sure that whatever device you may want to use this mouse with is compatible with Bluetooth 4.0, the level that this mouse uses.",

        "comment": "Something went wrong with my USB port and my wired mouse quit working. I knew I had Bluetooth connection on my laptop so decided to go with this unit. Paired easily, works perfectly. The software you can download for it adds some nice features too. \r\n\r\n I would really like to have availability of a more complete manual (sorry, I’m a little bit of a control freak I like to know what I can do with my units). What comes with the unit is just a brochure showing you how to set it up, not even how to put in the battery. Online is no better as there is absolutely nothing about this particular model.",

        "comment": "I really like the look and feel of this Bluetooth mouse. It is compact enough to carry with me, and it is large enough to give me a good stable mouse experience. I would like however, to have a back and forward browse buttons as other Microsoft mice.\n\nBattery life seems to be very good and the status light is helpful to know where the batter is in terms of duration. The on/off button is a little tricky, need to hold for a long time to bypass the pairing stage (especially once it has been paired already). Other than that, the traction and mouse performance is very accurate.",

The Bluetooth connectivity of the Kaira Pro is a nice plus. Black shark doesn’t have Bluetooth.",

Great fitment (I wear glasses too) sound quality is solid after updating and some custom EQ settings. Occasionally blown-out sound that was resolved by just powering off and on.

        "comment": "Seems like a great purchase so far. I bought one for my son and one for myself. Gaming without extra wires plugged into controller is amazing. Sound quality is very good, quick and easy set up. Battery hasn’t been an issue. Make sure you do a full charge on headset before use approx 4 hrs. All considered we are both very happy for the price (sale) and quality of headphones.",

Most up-to-date firmware and default EQ, and things just sound bad (games, Twitch, YouTube, video, etc).  I love Razer products, usually ... but I'll be returning these and I highly recommend you pass.  Apparently there's a reason they were significantly discounted.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My son had broke a lot of the wired headsets for use with the Xbox Series X.  A couple of them only last a couple of months before he somehow broke or messed up the wires.  This has been great, no issues with connectivity, sounds great and has great battery life.  He also prefers the sound in these versus the TV, so the room is quieter, just not him.",

        "comment": "The headset works exactly as advertised 99% of the time. In fact they are better than they're advertised as most of the time. I use them as my headphones for walking around the house, I use them for watching movies and the sound quality up and down the frequencies is amazing.\n\nProblem is the way the headset connects to the Xbox. \n\nIt connects using the same accessories function as the xbox controllers and remote controls. While this is an advantage being able to just connect straight to the console, no USB dongles, no wires, and all native, it also creates an intermittent distortion that cannot be remedied. It turns all your audio into a scratchy jumble to the point you can't make out what people in your party chat are saying to you. It only happens once in a while, but it's a known issue that has been around as long as these headphones have been on the market. \n\nIf you're looking for a competitive \"PRO\" gaming headset, this ain't it.",

The on/off is a tiny button that is flush with the underside so you will need a pen or pencil to turn it on and off easily. So far it has been able to take a beating. I travel with mine so it gets dropped and tossed into the carrying case on a regular basis. The bluetooth set up was easy. No need to tie up a usb port. Its a little pricey for a mouse.",

The scroll wheel is nice and the L / R clicks are tactile and audible. The precision is good for everyday tasks, office work, and general use. I don't think I could recommend this mouse for gaming, but if you're reading reviews for this mouse, then chances are, you're not looking for a gaming mouse. \n\nI was able to pick this thing up for around $22 dollars when BestBuy had some sales going on. If you're thinking about it, then wait for the sales and get one. I actually got two. I got a silver/platinum one, and a sandstone (rose gold / pink) color for my girlfriend. They are great mice! I only wish I could have got one in burgundy to match my surface. It's okay, I'm still really satisfied.",

Some people might not like the thinness of this (wireless) mouse. I like it, and I got the same color as my keyboard.",

Overall a great mouse and I love it so much more than what I had. So glad I bought it when I bought my new computer.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Yes. I'm an Android enthusiast. My Samsung S22 Ultra is a great phone, but I understand Apple gets a lot of the third party compatibility. Maybe that's due to the fragmentation of Android. Who knows? But I really don't appreciate companies that claim to be compatible with Android who are not truly compatible. This DJI Osmo Mobile 6 is a perfect example of that. Apple has an official app you can find in their app store, but Android is left with an APK (that my anti-virus program warned me about downloading) that needs to be side loaded. There needs to be more effort in labeling this on the box and in the product description. However, it still works for stabilizing, just don't think you'll be able to take advantage of all the zoom features and controlling options the stabilizer has. Luckily, I am mainly using it for family memories, so my Scorsese skills in film making will not need a lot of these controls. But I'd love for it to be available if the product is priced the same no matter if it all works or not. It'd be nice to have an Android edition, that may lack all features, but would be cheaper. The build quality is excellent though. Not too heavy, but hefty enough to feel the quality materials used. All in all, I'm glad I own it because as a stabilizer it works well. I just wish it was truly compatible with Android officially.",

        "comment": "This is a solid and portable gimble, from its hardware to its mobile app! It has a slight learning curve but is very easy to grasp. \n\nYou will have a wide range of stable and directional control for your videos/photos, and the extender arm and the tripod attachment make it a bonus for hitting those angles or those POV and selfie shots. \n\nI am also impressed with the thumb access to all of those buttons to trigger all of your iPhone's video and photo features without using the touchscreen. It is a very efficient and well-thought-out user experience. It would also be great if the trigger finger button could be customized as the video record or photo snapshot button.\n\nMy only gripe is the MagSafe clamp for iPhones using a protective case, as it could interfere with your buttons and continuously trigger them. It takes a little finesse, and it depends on your protective case, but you might be able to avoid it. Centering the MagSafe clamp is not difficult once you have done it a few times.\n\nIn some cases, you might need to offset the positioning of the clamp to avoid button triggering, which could also affect the gimble's auto-balancing feature in landscape mode. The gimble may also use more battery life to maintain its balance during landscape mode.\n\nHowever, if you still have button/balancing issues with the DJI MagSafe clamp, I came across a perfect adapter mount if you Google \"DJI magnetic ring holder phone clamp mount.\" It works perfectly with Magsafe iPhone cases and with the DJI Osmo 6 gimble!",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The DJI Osmo Mobile 6 Stabilizer is one of the coolest products I’ve used in some time. Right out of the set up is super easy, scan the QR code to take you to the app store and download the DJI Mimo App and pair it via Bluetooth. Once in the app there are multiple tutorial videos that help you get familiar with the DJI Osmo Mobile 6, which is a nice feature to have so you're not having to Google or go on Youtube to learn how to properly use this device.  The metal mounting clip is one of the better mounts I have come across, in that it stretches wide enough to grasp around my Iphone 14 Pro Max with a case on, I was for sure thinking that my case was going to be too bulky for it but it was able to. The Mimo software is great in that it basically mimics my iPhone’s camera interface but with some more options on the screen depending on which setting you are in, such as in photo mode where there is a shutter timer where you can pick from 3 seconds, 5 seconds and 7 seconds. In the Video mode it allows you to pick the resolution (720P,1080P or 4K) and what frame rate you would like to shoot in, which is super nice being able to pick that right from the camera interface and not having to dive into the setting to find it. Then the most outstanding feature of the DJI Osmo Mobile 6 has to be the head tracking feature in that when shooting video, a green box shows up and the arm will literally move and follow your head as you move which is perfect for filming things such as content or family videos. The buttons on the DJI Osmo Mobile 6 are very intuitive in that you get a Zoom knob, a record button, a focus stick that allows you to move the arm like you would with the right stick on a game controller, and A landscape to vertical button. There is a trigger button on the back of the handle that is not as intuitive and I highly recommend watching all the tutorial videos to learn all of its little tricks. In summary I think this is one of the best filming accessories you can buy to truly get the best photos and videos on your cell phone.",

If you have the OM5 model and you don't think the zoom button is something useful for you, than no need for upgrades. Otherwise, if you don't have phone stabilizer, definitely buy! Very noob friendly and useful for great content!",

It does take a little bit to set this up for first use with a firmware update during the initial setup.  Once past this and going through the various training videos provided within the app, some calibration to support the phone better (Samsung and Pixel Pro), thigs got only better.  This is very responsive in hold to movement for vertical and horizontal filming.  For first timer’s, this may seem a little overwhelming going through the initial steps depending on how familiar you are with what you’re presented.  For those with experience and/or knowledge, should walk through fairly easily from adding the app to your mobile device, establishing the Bluetooth connection, and getting to the operational play state.  Setup and play time took appox. 30 minutes due avid background with DJI product, other gimbals, and photography/video.  Part the time included playing around with all of the options presented to annoying some of my family while out and about taking footage of high-rise buildings.  Someone special had their own paparazzi for a little bit.\n\nThe gimble itself looks and feels very sturdy, easily unlocked and opened for attachment of your mobile device.  The magnet system on this and phone clamp attaches to the phone securely.  Perhaps one of the most notable changes added are the zoom and focus options as they aide you in getting your best shots.  It does telescope out to aide in those 360 degree and weird position footages where you need the extra length to capture appropriately.  I would highly recommend this for any new or current photographer looking for something to use with their mobile device.\n\nTo note, had to add one of my own wrist straps and capture cord to hand form my neck in the event I should drop the unit as nothing like this was provided in the box; a foul perhaps with the cost tied to this.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I enjoy creating digital content videos, photos, and reels in my spare time and was fortunate to find the new DJI Osmo Mobile 6 stabilizer. I was using an android and an iPhone to create the content which was fun to shoot on vacations and occasionally use a selfie stick with a remote control. I was so happy when I found the new DJI Osmo 6 Stabilizer which immediately made me realize why the price was set above what I expected for my first experience with the brand. I started with the unboxing of the product and noticed immediately that the luxurious quality of the device was far greater than I ever expected. I saw the various sturdy buttons along with the digital display that provides the status of the device and the type of recording you are set to start. Even the tripod stand was a higher quality of plastic and sturdier than my prior product. \n I was impressed with how strong the magnet was to firmly hold my brand-new iPhone 14 Pro Max which is not a light phone. When I hit the commands to flip my phone from portrait to landscape mode, I was thrilled to see it so quick and effortlessly. I downloaded the DJI application for my smartphones which I saw in the instructions and on the box. I found the setup videos and multiple device instruction videos to be extremely helpful for a newbie to the brand.\nI was able to pair it immediately via Bluetooth with my iPhone and it immediately started the setup process on the DJI Osmo gimble and in the application on my phone. I was like a kid having fun when I tried the various activities they take you through from shooting videos, to choosing a smaller area to target for video and then moved into the photo mode. After completing each task, it would flash a congratulatory type of message to let you know you were doing everything correctly. I was relieved that with so many features available on the device that the simple instructions took away the anxiety of having to learn how to make another accessory compatible with the smartphone I was using. I was able to use the device a couple of days before writing this review, so I found the best aspects of the smooth operating system that was satisfying for taking a chance on this new brand. I have already produced new media content and loved that the video stabilization feature proved to be great at keeping the final video from looking too shaky. I am confident that the Osmo Mobile 6 Stabilizer will be my go-to accessory when I create my special projects and for even fun family events to get everyone in the picture or produce even better videos \nI would highly recommend this product to my friends and family who have smartphones that are compatible with the devices listed on the company’s app and website. I look forward to many adventures with the brand and using their products on my international trips along with content created at home regularly.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Take your videos and even pictures to the next level.  This thing is awesome!  In the box you will find the device, stand, carrying case, and magnet for your phone.  I used this with an iPhone 4 pro and setup was a breeze.  During the app setup there is a quick tutorial that will help you understand how each button functions.  There are many short cuts like pushing certain buttons twice to change from wide or portrait mode.  It will take some time to learn the short cuts and become acclimated with it.  The website also offers guides and tutorials as well. \n\nThe motors that they used for the stabilizer are so smooth.  When recording a video you do not see the camera shake or jitter.  When the motors move there is no sound or jumping.  Its very comfortable to hold for long periods of time or you can even use the provided stand.  The overall feel is very premium and of a high quality. \n\nThe app that you download to use the stabilizer is easy to use.  It also offers different photo/video modes along with tips on how to take great videos.  The app quickly connects to the stabilizer via Bluetooth.  There is also no lag from the app to the stabilizer, everything happens quickly.  \n\nI'm a novice photographer, but this thing is so much fun to use and I can see taking it with me on vacation.  My favorite thing to use is the follow/tracking feature.  I was able to hold the stabilizer and it was able to track my dog running around the house.  I was amazed at how easily and quickly it kept on the dog.  This is by far my favorite feature of the stabilizer.  It will make taking videos a lot of fun and easy.\n\nThis is my first stabilizer and overall I love it!  I cannot wait to show it off to people and use it for videos.  The DJI is worth every penny as it is such a premium device.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The DJI Osmo Mobile 6  Gimbal is a very high quality, well designed mobile stabilizer.\n\nBut as an owner of the Google Pixel 6 I have to point out some of the negatives right from the start.\n\nFirst, the DJI MIMO app is not available in the Google Play Store. In order to download the app you must go into settings and allow download and installation of apps from unknown sources. That’s right, you must download an app from a Chinese company directly, without being verified by Google. This of course is accompanied by a warning that downloading this app may cause harm to your device and other apps on your device.  Not very comforting. In addition, not all features work on Android phones. Each phone model is different and therefore this may vary by device.\n\nAlso, I found that my phone was hotter in the Osmo than it is normally when its in camera mode, and the battery drained much quicker.\n\nOne other issue is the magnetic clip holder. It goes on the Pixel phone on top of the volume switch. If placed exactly in the middle of the phone it presses on the down volume switch and turns the volume all the way down.\n\nThe focus scroll wheel is also not functional with my Pixel phone.\n\nThe device itself is very high quality, very ergonomically designed. It is very well balanced in the hand and does not cause hand fatigue. All buttons and switches are placed within easy reach.\n\nDJI has videos in the app to fully explain the operation of each switch.\n\nIn the box you get the magnetic phone clip, the stabilizer unit, an attachable tripod and a charging cable.\n\nAfter you download the app, the Osmo 6 will automatically turn on when you attach the phone and off when the phone is removed.\n\nOne of my favorite features is face lock while in video. Your phone will lock on your face and follow you around. You can place the phone in the Osmo with the tripod, put it on a flat surface and record yourself while moving, and the camera will follow you. A push of a button will automatically switch between portrait and landscape.\n\nImage stabilization is of course a main reason for buying this device and it performs better than any phone by itself.\n\nThere is a scroll wheel for zooming in and out as well as a button for switching between video and photo.\n\nThere are way too many features to mention, however DJI does a great job of explaining the functions in video and with hints that appear on the screen.\n\nI would love to recommend this device, and I would to any iPhone user. But if you are an Android user I would weigh the positives and negatives before purchasing. I don’t know why DJI has put Android users in this situation and I hope that this situation changes sooner rather than later. This could easily be a5 start review if not for the software issues for Android.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Osmo Mobile 6 is a very fun smartphone gimbal stabilizer packed with great features to help you capture smooth, creative footage and fun photos. I like that a lot of what the gimbal has to offer is right at my finger tips. Changing modes, camera orientation, and angles is a click of a button or a push of the joystick away from personal customization. Each mode focuses on customizing which axis has priority over the movement of the camera. More on the modes below.\n\nDJI MIMO APP\nTo get the most out of the DJI Osmo Mobile 6, I suggest downloading the DJI Mimo app which allows you to use all the buttons to their fullest potential. Using the DJI Mimo app will unlock these additional button or handle features:\nSwitch between front and back camera\nSwitch between photo and video mode\nUse the focusing or zoom wheel\nUse the record button\n\nThe features listed above are not available to use with my Google Pixel Camera App. Here are the Osmo Mobile 6 buttons or handle features you can use WITHOUT the Mimo app (say like with your phone’s native camera app, these will just inherently work if the gimbal is on and the phone is mounted properly): \nJoystick\nSwitching between Landscape or Portrait orientation\nChanging Modes\nRe-centering with trigger button\nUsing the trigger to “lock” the view\n\nThe DJI Mimo app is very neat. I really like the subject-follow feature because it essentially allows you to set the camera down and let the app/camera follow your movement even without handling the gimbal itself. This is possible with the included mountable tripod which is an awesome accessory that’s included with this kit. My phone is not compatible with the focusing feature so the wheel on the side only allows me to zoom, not smoothly I might add, but not a dealbreaker.\n\nEXTENDING FEATURE\nThis gimbal also extends so you can get high up drone-like shots or very low shots. It’s like a selfie stick, but better because it’s also a gimbal! The only downside to this is that because of the extendable feature, you have to be careful when taking it to amusement parks as they often don’t allow extendable devices like this one.\n\n4 GIMBAL MODES\nOut of the 4 modes, the one that’s more “general” or easiest to work with is the first one: Follow mode. It’s going to either pan up or down, left or right, depending on which way you move the camera, and it won’t “roll” sideways. \n\nThe second mode: Tilt Lock, will do just that, lock the tilt and allow you to pan left or right with natural hand movement. If you want to change the angle of the tilt in Tilt Lock mode, just use the joystick to bring the camera’s view up or down. \n\nThe third mode: FPV will actually follow any movement on all 3 axes, so you get more dynamic or creative shots with this mode as it will “roll” (turn the camera sideways) as you’re following a subject. \n\nThe fourth mode: SpinShot allows you to naturally “roll” the camera sideways while still facing a subject, as well as lets the joystick rotate the camera as well, whereas in the other modes, the joystick is moving the camera angle up, down, left or right. SpinShot allows the camera to tilt sideways. To get a visual of what this looks like, look straight ahead then lean your head to one side like you’re putting your ear to your shoulder, and keep looking straight. This is the “roll” effect I’m talking about.\n\nOVERALL\nI love playing with this gimbal. I take it to local music shows and plan to take it to a festival to get some smooth footage and fun pictures. It’s great for people who like to film videos whether it’s for an event or an artistic video piece. This gimbal has plenty of modes to work with to get super creative shots or just get nicely stable footage. I’ve only had to charge it once so far and I’ve used it a few times. There’s a nice indicator screen that shows you modes, battery level, and will let you know with a red light above the battery indicator if the magnet is not secured properly. I can definitely recommend this gimbal to anyone who likes video tech or looking to gift it.",
