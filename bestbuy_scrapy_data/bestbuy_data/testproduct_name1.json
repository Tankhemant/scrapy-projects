        "comment": "I bought the Solis unit to be used as a portal mobile Wi-Fi in my vehicle as some places that I travel through for my job are not always cell friendly. There is a particular stretch of rural highway that I travel frequently where my Verizon cell goes to zero bars in spots. I had success with a built in AT&T Wi-Fi in my previous vehicle but my replacement vehicle did not have a built in so I purchased the Solis as it advertised that it would automatically lock onto the strongest network in the area. Needless to say, I have been extremely disappointed. In the areas that I need it most, it will take a very long time to lock on to a signal and will not always stay locked in. This is especially frustrating when I'm supposed to be on a Teams meeting for work while driving. I called tech support and explained my issue and told them how the previous AT&T Wi-Fi unit I was using had very little trouble in this area but for some reason the Solis would not lock onto the AT&T signal on a consistent basis. I was told to do a reset on the unit. That really didn't work. Sometimes the unit would work fine in the rural areas but it would not lock in on a good signal on a regular basis and I got tired of pulling over to try to work with it. I think this would probably work fine as a \"sit in one place\" device in an area that is not out in the middle of nowhere...although AT&T still works there......but as a mobile Wi-Fi for your vehicle, it's awful. Since I've had it for almost 6 months, I guess I'm stuck with it so I'll use up the data I've pre-purchased and then do who knows what with it.",

        "comment": "I researched hotspots prior to some lengthy trips in Europe this last year. Skyroam was newer to the game, but strongly recommended. I've had the, \"puck\" nicknamed after its hockey puck shape overseas 9 out of 12 months. ES, IT, England, FR, DE, Switzerland, Amsterdam, Belgium, Iceland, Sweden, Thailand and Norway. No problems at all. The shape fits in your front pocket easy. Doesn't slide around on a car dash. At first, I wasn't sure of the color, but it's easy to not lose because it stands out. The cell phone app works great. Easy to turn subscriptions on and off at will.\n\nAustin helped me with a technical glitch. The puck was using a Spanish IP address when I was in DE. Triggered my security software with my bank. Austin remotely reset the device, problem solved. Quick turn around with tech support if you need it. I got a regular USB C charger that tops off the battery in 2 or 3 hours.\n\nI'm completing a cross country European tour this Friday. 1900 mile road trip. No glitches from cell tower to cell tower or crossing borders. \"The puck is tough!\"\n\nMy sister's friend borrowed the puck for a trip to Thailand. No issues either.\n\nI cut the cord with cable TV. I'm considering cutting the cell service and using Skyroam exclusively with my cell in airplane mode using wifi. It'll work for my home wifi TV's at home.\n\nI think the biggest advantage to Skyroam over activating your cell phone overseas is that you can have 5 devices on hotspot versus just one using my cell. This worked great for traveling with a small group.\n\nI've had 3 of my close friends buy Solis after using my hotspot. It just works so well.",

        "comment": "My Solis Lite has not been able to connect to a signal once. That is not an exaggeration. I feel like I was tricked. I bought this device for working while I travel around the globe. I bought it as a backup in case my hotel wifi goes out or I want to work at a cafe for the day. That way, I could still get my work done.\n\nThis bad review can be broken into 2 parts. 1) the device does has not worked once for me. 2) customer support said the device would work in the countries I needed it to work in.\n\nBefore I purchased, I contacted the support team to see if the Solis Lite works in the countries I would be visiting. The support team confirmed the device worked well in those countries. My trip consisted of visiting Nepal and Albania.\n\nUnfortunately, the device does not come close to living up to the marketing on the website. The website claims that the \"Solis Lite is the perfect hub for any on-the-go lifestyle. You can stay online anywhere to navigate your journey or share moments anytime.\"\n\nWhile the places I am visiting are not the most popular places in the world, the Solis Lite website claims that their device works in those countries and their customer support confirmed that to me pre-purchase. I am not sure where their device works in the country because I've tried using it in 5 different cities all around the country. The only place I haven't tried using it is in the capital, which I am not planning on visiting.\n\nWhen I have contacted customer support, they claim that the area I am visiting is \"very rural\" and that is why I am not getting a signal, even though I am traveling through decent sized cities.\n\nI would not recommend buying this device based on my experience. Maybe it works in the United States or major European capitals.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I hate this thing so much.\n\nI purchased this for a road trip from Arizona to my home in Alaska in my campervan. I work remotely and needed an internet solution for my time in Canada. I only get 5gb of Data in Canada with my cellular plan and I was looking for a good solution for work.\n\nI purchased this because it offers a North America Data plan and supposedly runs off of all major carrier cell towers, so in theory, if there is cell service on a cellular provider, I should also have internet. I don't and it is garbage.\n\nI can have full bars of LTE on my phone and somehow, my stupid orange puck can't seem to find any internet. Additionally, if there is internet it can say I have full bars on the Solis app but it cuts out severely on every single TEAMS call I have during the day and I constantly get \"reconnecting\" errors. I am sitting in the middle of town when this happens. There is cellular service. \n\nI'm pretty sure Solis gets the worst, lowest level, leftover data blocks from the carriers. At nearly $100 for 50 gigs of internet, it ought to work well. \n\n I hate this stupid thing. It doesn't work. Don't buy it. It is a glorified paperweight.",

        "comment": "I bought one of these for a recent trip to Portland where I was at a house with no internet. I chose the Solis Lite because it was cheaper than enrolling in unlimited internet from Verizon and I thought it might come in handy when I travel internationally.\n\nUnfortunately, there are only two plans I could use with this device, a daily plan that is about $5 and an almost $50 monthly plan that limits you to 20 GB at the higher speed until it slows down to 3G during the month. I used up that 20GB in the first few days, and frankly, the \"high speed\" was pretty darn slow, which I thought was weird in a large city that should have plenty of access to high speed sources. There's was no way to purchase faster speed after the 20GB was used, so I ended up having internet that was super slow. Mostly, I had to use my Verizon internet on my iPhone that wasn't part of this WiFi system. Another problem was that the Solis seemed to disconnect a lot. My MacBook was constantly looking for the WiFi, because it the Wi-Fi hotspot was not consistently there.\n\nI still have yet to test it internationally and I'm crossing my fingers that it will work; but if I had my choice again, I would not buy this device.",

        "comment": "I live in the country and thought this would be a worthy replacement for my horribly unreliable satellite internet, but I was wrong. It works ok for working from home and streaming movies (yay!) but because of cell carriers’ “fair use policies,” it’s unable to process large downloads, and I was unable to connect my gaming consoles to the hotspot. This is not mentioned anywhere on Skyroam’s website, and I had to contact customer support three times before I could get an answer about it, and even then their response was “it seems like it won’t work,” which isn’t exactly definitive... Their “solution” was to recommend that I pay for their pay-as-you-go plan, which offers full speed downloads at a rate of $6 per gigabyte. That’s just outrageously unrealistic if I’m downloading large files. I fully understand the limitations at play here, but some more transparency upfront would have been much-appreciated before I spent the money on this device and an extra $99 on the “unlimited” data plan. (Please note that because this device is pre-packaged with a free GB of data, you’ll either have to use the full 1GB or contact customer support to in-bundle it if you want to switch to the unlimited plan).",

        "comment": "I’m a nomad and have used multiple hot spots. This one is definitely the worst. The app is crap. It rarely loads and once it does, service information won’t change until you force quit and restart it. Which is extremely annoying. The service itself is mediocre at best and too expensive for what they deliver. It gets service maybe a quarter of the time I have service on my phone and calling it high speed is laughable. Even when the app says I have full bars of service, it takes a few minutes to load a webpage and definitely doesn’t work for video calls or mail etching any type of video. I hoped at first it was just based off my first country of use but I’ve found this to be true through multiple countries including the US, Canada, Iceland, England, Scotland, Greece and Italy. Their customer service is pretty quick though, which would be great if it was a fixable problem and not just a crappy product. I would definitely say if you have any actual need for reliable, high speed internet that Solis is not the way to go and is definitely disappointing.",

        "comment": "I travel quite a bit and I’m tired of having to buy a separate SIM card and have my phone unlocked every time I switch phones so I settled for skyroam.\n\nThe device is not perfect and the quality is not the most durable, however it also depends how an individual handles their electronic gadgets. The reason I gave it a 5 is because based on the service they gave me I believe they’ll keep improving.\n\nI’ve recently just got back from my two week road trip from FR through Switzerland and IT. The device worked for me for the most part. Stopped working for brief periods in situations like changing borders, changing signals. I’ve also noticed when you plug it in to charge sometimes the signal drops.\n\nI like that it shows on the app whether you’re on a 4G or 3G network. Works perfect for keeping google maps updated through out the long drives and Spotify playing at the same time.\n\nWith that said, could use updates on the firmware for faster load up and Avoid unnecessary signal drops.",

All of us could connect as long as we were close enough to the hotspot. We used day passes but are wondering if other plans would be more economical.",

The buttons are harder to operate since there's no words, you just have to know how long to hold each one for turning on and off. You Can't start a day pass without the app on your phone, while on the old device, I could start from the device. Prefer the operation design of the older model.",

Mike was very helpful and demonstrated great customer service by addressing my questions and concerns. He kept me abreast of his findings and had me back on-line in moments. In this day and age of connectivity, you just can't travel abroad without this pocket size personal WiFI. Great Job!",

Yes, it was not the fastest, but when you need internet, you will get it.  International unlimited cost $99 for 1 month of service (with a speed cap at 20GB, after 20GB, you can use at diminished speeds).  I look forward to have this in my international travel bag so I will have internet anywhere I go.",

        "comment": "Very disappointed with the connection speeds. I was expecting something better than my cellphone hotspot, instead I got something much much slower, making me wonder why I even bought this paperweight. I have only used it in the US, but if it's this slow at home with great cellphone coverage, I can only imagine how bad it will be abroad. Setup and form factor are great, but the usability truly is dissapointing.",

I imagine it will be good for travel. \n\nThe downside is that I used half of my data within the first few min (according to the app) and then just a fraction over an hour of usage, so it’s not very reliable in that way and I worry that I may run out of data when I need it. \n\nOverall, works well, but I’ll probably have limited use for it.",

        "comment": "I bought a couple of the original versions before our trip to Rome and London. I had a little trouble getting started in using it so I messaged them on Favebook messenger and to my surprise, they messaged me back within 15 mins. Within about 10 mins after that I was on my way. It worked great. I have used it in Rome, London, MX, Honduras, Cayman Islands, and Jamaica and all with no problems. When the new version came out, I knew I was going to buy it. I guess when I heard it was new, more portable and a charger, I assumed it would be more compact but it’s not as compact as I hoped for but it worked just as great as before. My son borrowed it to make a large download on his xbox and he had no problems. They make it easy to buy more days and add it to the unit. Now if they could just figure out how to make it useable on a cruise ship, they’d make a fortune and control the market.",

        "comment": "I'll preface this with, the first test run I had of this product was in Guatemala. So not the most developed country in the world, and I was in some pretty remote areas where this device couldn't get a signal, so I'm not sure if I would fault the device terribly for that. The locals with cell phones did have a network signal though, so it was odd that people could get a cell phone signal but this little device couldn't. But regardless, when this device did have a signal, it was very dependable and very fast, and I liked having my own, private, secure WiFi to use. Between me and my husband's 2 iPhones, we used about 2 GB of data over the course of 10 days internationally. The battery on the device easily lasted all day long too, and the app makes it very easy to track and see data usage and battery life. I'm sure this hotspot also works like a dream in more developed countries as well.",

Then I changed to an unlimited day pass, speeds were abysmal, so the unlimited come as the price of speed.",

Not only does it act as a hotspot but can also be used as a power bank. The Solis is easy to set up. There are several options to choose for the amount of gigs you want. It all depends on how you want or need to connect. The best part is the fact that there is no contract.",

Tried to connect to it at home, but phones still couldn't see it.  One of 2 laptops was able to connect at the house, but not at the camper.  So, it's pretty much useless for us.  I'll be trying to return it.",

It has been a\nGodsend, we are in a mobile home and as we were driving we had a wifi hotspot with us so we could use our google maps to get us to our destination. We could watch movies, FaceTime our friends back In CA, keep up with our emails. Thank you thank you. Recommend to every traveller.",

I imagine you could connect 10 devices to this, if it were five people holding two devices standing shoulder to shoulder in a circle!\nI know now why they charged me a $45 restocking Fee, because many people are trying to return them. The almost 40% restocking cost is to deter you to even return it.",

I expected the quality to be about cell phone wifi hot spot level, which I hadn't realize was so lousy until I tried to actually stream music through it. The Solis Lite came into my life and legitimately I was blown away by how great it functions. I've had zero connectivity issues in western Massachusetts, USA, and the speed has been greater than I had hoped, and stable. I've recommended this product to a few of my friends who are now probably sick of me raving about it. Thank you, Skyroam, for making such a great little device and providing this service!",

No more looking for free wifi after leaving the ship. When at home or traveling, I take it with me when hiking or even when doing chores around town. Wifi is always with me in my car.

I was really happy with the new smaller design however the device and service has really let me down.\nI have only used the unit 3 times since I purchased it once in Bucharest once in Warsaw where I simply could not connect to the service. This was poor but I have had trouble connecting other devices in those countries \nBut the biggest failure was in HK where I connected really easy but the Unlimited day Pass was so slow after the first 30 mins it was unusable. I was tempted to purchase unlimited monthly passes but I’m so worried that the service will be so slow it will not be worth it.\n\nMassive disappointment, Can I return It?",

The service continues to be extremely unreliable despite people around me being able to connect to and use the cellular network for the same activities (and more) than what I am trying to use it for. Support was working for a bit, but now my chat with support refuses to work whenever I don’t have WiFi for calls (even though I have enough WiFi to stream music). I emailed support via the website yesterday to express my frustration problems and have yet to hear from anyone. Please do yourself a favor and look at other products.",

Once it connected it worked fine and did what it is suppose to do. Worked with their customer support on live chat and first he said it wouldnt work in a Verizon area and then few minutes later said it should still connect to any tower. He said he reset something on his end and said to power down and wait. Still didnt help. Tried mutiple times. Dont try their emal.

I have to shut down my PC, shut down the wifi device and reboot. \n\nIf I had not been forced to switch from Solis 1 to solis Lite 5g, I wouldn't be using Solis Lite.\n\nThe service is not stable.",

        "comment": "This is such a great idea and device. It's only at 4G, sadly. However, as always the midwest has issues with towers connections strength being weaker than heck. How it works is it will connect to the strongest provider and you can use their connections. It's either TMobile, AT&T, One Cellular like towers. I bet it is way better overseas like Europe or Asia since networking out there is top notch. Plans are great deal and affordable. I was using unlimited per day pass so it doesn't throttle like the 20G per month.\n\nAnyway until it has 5G+ and towers are update maybe be useful in the USA deadzones. I recommend only if you travel a lot and need to do most the work you could on the go.",

        "comment": "When you turn it on, you have to install an app on your phone on which you buy the data. The hotspot uses that connection to give you internet on any other devices. You can buy it up-front in small packages or have it auto-charge. I did both options at different times - did you want to watch a movie on Netflix? My paypal was dinging so much that I didn't even get through a movie without my balance being at $45. I live in SF and my cell service is Verizon. I must've used it twice successfully, and all other times unsuccessfully, and I needed it to do my work! The Solis people were unresponsive to my emails for help or through the app. What a disappointment, and when I needed it to do my work, too.",

I’m on a lot of Teams calls and can go through up to 5GB or more a day, and throttling makes it impossible to connect to meetings. Even the 20GB plan runs out in less than a week.\n\nNot a useful device or solution for my needs, but also did not do a good job of connecting to the best available network even for minimum needs.",

        "comment": "After issues using our mobile carriers' international service on our first international trip that caused us quite a bit of grief, we swore off using them and looked for a different option. This little thing was exactly what we wanted! It's small and easily fits in my bag that I carry around(and would fit in most purses), the signal was almost always stellar, and the speed was fast enough for all of our needs. It felt like the battery was lasting as long as advertised, and then it charged up fast when it was low. The global day passes worked great for our needs and it saved us some money because we could both connect to it, as compared to us both having to buy individual day passes from our mobile carriers. 15/10 recommend!",

It is easy to set up using the Solis App. I use the pay-per-day option for data so that I am only paying when I need to use it. It saves me money when I travel internationally too. I no longer need to purchase my cell service's international travel plan. The Solis connect up to 10 devices so in addition to my laptop I use it with my phone and then use WiFi calling. It is so light and portable I just stick in my bag or back pocket.",

Used it for the first time in Tokyo everywhere with no problems. Speed was fast and the ability to charge my phone was invaluable. Needed to use Google Map constantly 12-16 hours per day and never lost my Solis wifi connection even in the Tokyo train and subway stations. The battery life was excellent even when I had to charge my phone.\nIf you travel, this is a must have. It's an excellent product.",

        "comment": "Great little WiFi hotspot!  I bought this for my international travels.  In January 2022 I traveled to Barbados and Saint Lucia in the Carribean and this little guy worked exceptionally well.  As soon as I landed I was able to turn it on, connect to the WiFi and effectively have internet to get in touch with my hired shuttle driver and my friends.  The battery lasted pretty much all day and allowed me to get internet on my phone at the beach, in the ungle, wherever I needed it.  In about two weeks I used a little over 1 GB of data, but I had a bunch left from purchasing 20GB during Black Friday :) Very convenient for frequent travelers who don't want to have to worry about purchasing new SIM cards each time they move to a new spot.",

The app is ok, I don't love the interface but it gets the job done. \n\nIt is slow to connect initially as it scans the network which is frustrating as I am mostly using this as a backup for when my primary internet goes out.\n\nThe speed is unreliable, I mostly use it for Zoom meetings and it usually starts fine but within minutes I get messages saying that my internet connection is unstable or slow. \n\nI wish I could also check my data balance and usage on their website as I don't always have my phone handy when I need to use this on my laptop.\n\nIt's great for casual use while traveling to check emails and browse the web but I am not impressed for remote work as I use Zoom a lot.",

I was following their easy instructions but got hung up on reading the QR code.  I would scan it, after 20 seconds I got the message 'Oops. It didn't work.  Try again later.\"  I know I tried at lease 15 times and always got the same message but no explanation of what was wrong so I assume it was on their end.  I tried their online help and I never could find anything about that error message.  I used the online support and got the message that they were not online.  I spent at least 4 hours  and finally reached my frustration breaking point and returned the item.  Easy instructions were not.",

It's working OKAY, but I'm not sure I'd try taking it to Africa or a less populated country (like somewhere in South America). \n\nAfter all the WhatsApp pauses, we haven't tried to stream any shows; figure it would be too frustrating!",

The other day the internet went down in my home and I was able to buy a 24-hour pass that allowed me to have wifi for just when I needed it.

I have used it in many, many countries and the connection has been great in all of them…even the most remote! I’m not sure how it works in US as I don’t use it there.\nIt is easy to use, cost effective and the battery charge lasts all day.  My travel companions (3) can connect and as long as they are close to my Solis they get their WhatsApp and email. I’ve never been so popular!! \nThis is my second (upgraded) hotspot from this company and I have been totally satisfied with both. \nGreat customer service helped me transfer unused daypasses from old model to new without issues.\nIt solved my travel problem and it can solve yours!",

If you sign an auto renew and want to upgrade your plan, you have to cancel (and lose data) in order to be able to upgrade. This can also only be done when you are in range of the unit.  I expect it will be useful when I travel since I don't connect to public wifi. even with the negatives, I would still recommend it as a decent alternative to public wifi or no wifi at all",

If I wanted to buy a more expensive plan I would have chosen a 5G plan through my current carrier. The day pass\napproach was exactly what I was looking for until this limit showed up. Don't waste your money on this device if you want to use the day passes.",

If I use it I cannot use my Square to accept payments.  The Customer Support from Solis/Skyroam is non-existant!!!  The website doesn't work as it NEVER lets me sign in, even changing my password EVERY TIME I want to log in.  The device works great on our patio, but is not an option for a secure connection when used in conjuction with a Square.  I hope it works when we are camping remotely, but I have yet to try it.  Maybe it would be a good thing if it didn't work.  I am trying to 'turn off' the service until summer, and I cannot even get in touch with the company to do that.  If you buy this and have success with it.  I hope you'll include that in your reviews.  Good Luck!!!",

        "comment": "It was helpful having wifi, however the device constantly dropped the connection. We had to keep on reconnecting and had to switch our cell data off to avoid being charged when it automatically switched to data after the Solis device dropped the wifi connection. The speed was ok. It took a while to boot up each time turning it on. The size was fine. Not small enough to place in pocket but ok for a bag. It did seem to get very hot when using it and had to try cooling it down.",

I have used the hotspot in Dallas, Dubai, Kolkata, and Asansol (plus other locations in the US) and have never experienced any trouble getting internet connectivity. The only time I had to contact Skyroam support, their response was prompt and efficient. Thank you Biron and Rain. I would highly recommend this product.",

I've used a few other hotspots through carriers in the past and would ALWAYS lose my connection. I can honestly say I did not lose my connection once while on my drive from San Diego to Utah. Battery life was top notch as well, I used the device for a total of 6 hours on the road and got home with more than 80% left. Can't recommend this device anymore, very content!",

Now all I do it turn it on before I leave my hotel/apartment and I am always connected to work, voip cell service and texting. Small form factor so you can put it in a jacket pocket and have wifi at all times. Customer support answers quickly and is very efficient. Great product and company---many thanks!",

        "comment": "This hotspot has been great for me since I've been working from home during the pandemic. I use it on my rooftop, where my home WiFi does not reach. Also, sometimes I take a Zoom call from the car when my kids are being too loud inside. We recently took a road trip to Montana and it was great to have WiFi for the kids so they didn't smoke the battery using my phone hotspot. The best part about it is that they use multiple networks and I don't need a physical SIM card.",

Next, the app says you have no plan. If I exhausted the data, it should say that. There is no visibility in what device used how much data. There is no support, the app live chat support no one responds. The return windows was 14 days so stuck with this device. Overall, I cannot recommend this device to anyone.",

However the device worked well when we were in port as well as at the various port stops.\n\nWe used the Solis in Copenhagen, Stockholm, Helsinki, St. Petersburg, Tallinn, Berlin and Oslo and the device worked well in all these cities. We are an older couple and we had no problems setting up the device. We charged the device every night and so did not run out of battery power. The wifi signal was strong and we were able to surf the internet with ease.\n\nOn two occasions I phoned the support line (1-855-759-7626) and received prompt, polite and useful advice. I would not hesitate to recommend the device to friends and I would also use the device again when I am travelling.",

There were few issues but the Skyroam team were there to assist and got me on track right away. You wont regret using this especially if you are the type who travels internationally like JP, Korea, Guam, etc. I have yet to explore the stateside but if their signal could reach internationally what more in the states?!",

The only frustrating thing is that a few times, (when switching carriers I guess), it would drop the connection for a minute. I got cut off in a couple meetings, but it always got me back online quickly. But overall, reliable, convenient, FAR better wifi than I’d get using my phone as a hotspot, and the daypasses are affordable.",

A constant supply of WiFi helped us travel around foreign cities without getting lost and allowed us to keep in touch with our relatives at home. Occasionally the Skyroam would take a few minutes to connect to our mobile devices, but it never deterred us from going somewhere. We would simply take the Skyroam with us knowing that our devices would connect automatically in a couple minutes.",

They essentially told me that it's good enough, even though I can't get a stable connection for conference calls.",

Still, nothing. Bizarre. \n\nI guess when it works these things work incredible, but doesn't work everywhere?",

The area where I&#39;m using it is under the front porch, concrete on all sides, so more damp than a comparable living space of that size, but quite small for a conventional dehumidifier. In a closet or other small living space, the Vanguard would probably be fine. Its quiet, uses little electricity, and accumulates water in the reservoir, so it&#39;s doing its job as advertised.",

We live in a condo apartment that gets lots of condensation on the windows when the weather is cold and doesn't have the best air circulation because of he use of baseboard heaters. We use the 2 in 1 in one of our 150 sqft bedrooms. The dehumidifier is not excellent but good and the air purifier good. Yes, I would recommend this product but for a smaller room.

It shuts off automatically when full; I dump it out, then turn it back on. Best of all, it&#39;s small and unobtrusive. I highly recommend it for a room.

Noise level is a personal observation but to me, I would call it a quiet \"white noise\". They are not loud. I would recommend them if asked. We have had them in use for a week so far.",

When it is time to change the filter.. so that will be interesting to see how easy and how dirty. I will buy one for the bedroom if it is easy to replace filter. it has 2 speeds.. it is quieter on the low speed.",

While we don’t notice the air purification as of yet, am happy to have this feature, and looking forward to having it come wildfire season. \nThe most satisfying part is seeing how much water is pulled from the air!",

Within two hours of running this little devil my room smells great, and I can take deep easy breaths in with no raspy feeling that dusty and pollen gives me. Being that I have a small canine the room also always has a smell of dog. Right now my room smells like fresh air you get a whiff of on the way to the ocean, before the salt, but in between the city smog and the clean breeze of the coast. Very small and light weight. I think my favorite part is there is no superfluous options, though I&#39;d of enjoyed having a timer to set it so it would turn off after an hour of being out of the house.",

I put a digital thermometer/humidity meter in the car with the dehumidifier running. After a day 2 cups of water were pulled out of the air in the vehicle. I emptied it a few more times with less water each day over a week and now the humidity is down to a level where mold will not grow. It would also be great for a gun safe since it is quite small but does pull a remarkable amount of moisture from the air for it&#39;s size. I&#39;m not sure how well it would work for a whole room since I only used it in a small space but my experience so far has been positive.",

        "comment": "I intentionally bought this air purifier/ dehumidifier, because I was hoping it would make noise (in addition to it purifying the air and draining water of course). I work grave shifts at my job, and I prefer to have a more natural sounding white noise other than what a smart phone app can provide while I&#39;m sleeping during the day. It actually wasn&#39;t as loud as I was hoping. I ended up switching it out for the one in my daughter&#39;s room, and it seems to work great! It seems to work well in the amount of space, is easy to use, and makes enough noise to be her sound machine without being overwhelming during the night. If you are looking for one that is completely silent, however, this maybe isn&#39;t the one for you.",

        "comment": "I suppose it works as advertised, but it doesn&#39;t pull water out fast enough to change the humidity in our bedroom more than a few points from ambient. In other words, if relative humidity outside is 60%, the lowest this unit will bring RH in a room is about 55%. If you plan to use it in a room with a draft, or any room bigger than a small bedroom, you will want a bigger /faster drying unit.",

The control panel is touch sensor and can be controlled by your smartphone. This is very nice and convenient. \nThe noise isn't loud. \nThe size is appropriate, not too small, not too big. It fits perfectly in my bed room. \nThe value and the quality is amazing!!",

        "comment": "This is a great little unit! I moved into a 2 bedroom apartment that was so humid it was uncomfortable. I didn&#39;t want to spend a ton of money or get a large dehumidifier due to limited space and because winter will be here soon so I thought I would give this one a try and would pass it on to my brother for use in his RV if my place was too big for it to handle. I knew it wasn&#39;t really built to handle an entire apartment so I wasn&#39;t expecting it to be perfect but it has made a measurable improvement and is the perfect size for my needs. It&#39;s super quiet and reliably shuts itself off when full which was also important to me. Rather than buying a large unit I would recommend starting with one of these and adding a second one later if one isn&#39;t enough.",

It tried to keep going but just couldn't.\nOne week later I had a new device and it is now working perfectly on a separate outlet from the heater. All is good. \nI've noticed a decrease of humidity from average 60's to 50's and lower when this is in working order. I empty it every 3 or 4 days. I'm breathing much better now that's back in place.\nKudos to the customer service team for making the return and inspection an easy and pleasant process.",

I feel that it takes a long time to gather up a good amount of water. It did it&#39;s job, just really small and takes time to gather water.  The air purifier is a simple HEPA filter. Nothing too special but it works.",

I only run the dehumidifier when I am at work but it has made a noticeable change in the humidity in the room. I am surprised about how much moisture it pulls from the room. What sealed the deal was this also cleans the air! Double Whammy!  While I can&#39;t say how this would work in a large room or house, I recommend it highly for anyone trying to get humidity out of a small room or office.",

Customer service has also been amazing -- fast &amp; friendly responses and prompt delivery -- and a quick resolution to a Canada Post error. I definitely recommend this product and company!",

Emptying the collected water is very simple with the reservoir just sliding out of the back of the unit. Perfect for closets, bathrooms, bedrooms, and other smaller rooms.",

        "comment": "I've been using this air purifier/dehumidifier for a month now. I would say that it's been working very well so far. This summer has been rainy so it can get mildly hot and humid in my apartment. I was using those moisture absorbers (with the white beads) from the dollar store for a while, but I felt like it wasn't sufficient in really sucking the moisture out of the air.   I use the JS Vanguard in my living/dining room (approx 240 sqft area) or my washroom which can get quite damp (no windows). I typically leave it running while I'm at work and it accumulates about 1/4 of the small tank of water. I've also left it running over the weekend if I'm going away, and it accumulates over 1/2 a tank of water. I've yet to let it fill all the way.   In terms of air purification, I don't have any pets and there aren't any particularly terrible odours in my apartment, but I've noticed there is a lot less dust gathering on the floor of my unit, so I am very happy about that. Before using this device, I'd have a lot of dust gathering each week.  All in all, I'd say it was well worth the money. It's a beautifully designed appliance that functions very well.",

        "comment": "I purchased this as a tool to help monitor my grandmother’s heart because she has had issues over the past couple of years and not to mention her 3 brothers and my grandmothers father all had Congestive Heart Failure and 2 out of the 3 brothers died from CHF. My grandmother has a very significant arrhythmia that you can actual identify when listening with a stethoscope however it did not register when I used this device. That was what first threw me off. So I tested it on myself, friends, family etc and it was correct about 80% of the time. It just so happened my grandmother had to go in to the hospital for another issue but she was hooked up to a “6 lead” EKG 100% of the time, in addition to a blood pressure cuff that was always attached and periodically took measurements and the finger sensor to check her blood oxygen saturation levels. (All of these wires hook in to a monitor that records all the different values and an alarm will go off if your levels go outside of the set ranges)— so when I went to see her I brought the small Kardia device with me and I took 6 different readings. All panned out every 10 minutes and I got a printout from the monitoring device every time I used the Kardia and for the most part, it was accurate HOWEVER it did not pick up on the fact that she has “chronic congestive heart failure with preserved ejection fraction” aka “diastolic heart failure.” In order to diagnose that you need either a 6 or 12 lead EKG. What was even more offputting is that it never once picked up here very obvious arrhythmia that she’s had since her 20’s. \n\nThis device is a 1 lead EKG. It’s picking up the basic electrical current that flows through your body. This device also only programmed to pick up on 6 different heart issues. There are WAY MORE than 6 abnormalities that the heart can exhibit signs of via an EKG. For the most part a 6 lead is truly what you need. That pick up on peripheral electrical signals that run through the body. A 12 lead is the REAL DEAL but most of the time, not truly needed. As we grow older, yes of course a 12 lead helps pick up everything including the electrical current that runs through our extremities.\n\nLastly, and the final straw that convinced me to return it is that they avidly market the product as “FDA-cleared” (which doesn’t even come close to being “FDA-approved”) and even though they market as being “cleared” there is no evidence on their website regarding clinical trials and testing and results and comparisons. At least not that I could find, and if there are testing results on their site that I happened to missed, I still would have returned it. They also have no indication on whether or not they are seeking FDA approval. To me, that says “we will continue to say we are FDA “cleared” because most people don’t know what the difference between cleared and approved and let’s continue to sell a device that’s fancy but not entirely  accurate. Being FDA cleared just means that the FDA has recognized the device as being very similar to a predicate already being marketed and sold on the market and that the device is not harmful in any way. AKA-the FDA has verified (through an independent lab group btw, not their own government labs) that the product won’t kill you and that it’s relatively similar to another product on the market. That’s it. I am a big believer in math and science and when it comes to medicine I want to see facts, results, lab tests, clinical trials, etc etc. I won’t touch this product or any of their others with a 10 foot pole until I either see “FDA approved” or some scientific clinical information showing the efficacy of the product.",

        "comment": "I am a retired physician with some weird heart rhythms and wanted to be able to check my status between checkups.  It is very frustrating to experience feelings of my heart skipping beats, yet by the time I get to my doctor’s office for my next visit, my rhythm is stone cold normal.  This device allows me to capture pictures of my heart rhythm when it is acting up.  Then, if it is necessary, my doctor can order a 12 lead EKG, or a 24 hour Holter monitor to fully assess my rhythm.  It is invaluable when such rhythms are sporadic, since you can capture the irregular rhythm and relate it to time of day, activity, stress, caffeine, etc…. This device does not replace a 12 lead EKG, or a 24 hour monitor, but it does an excellent job of identifying the 4 basic concepts of heart rhythm interpretation.  Fast; Slow; Regular; Irregular.  It also does a fairly accurate job of allowing measurement of QT intervals, QRS width and, in many cases, the differentiation between PVCs and PACs.  You need to have a physician’s opinion for true identification of these issues, as well as things like heart blocks and brief periods of A-fib, but to get you started and to monitor yourself between doctor visits, this device is very much worth its purchase.  I use it for home monitoring for my family.  I am quite pleased with this device and am glad I purchased it.",

        "comment": "My dad has A Fib and he was having issues with RVR, rapid ventricular response. We were looking online for something that could up us identify if his rhythm changed and when he needed to contact his doctor or go to the emergency department. We purchased the  AliveCor Kardia device and loved it!  One night we were hosting family game night and we were so excited about our new technology toy that we thought it would be fun to do tracings on everyone there!! It was all in fun and amazement at the new cool technology gadget!! However things became serious when my cousins husband who was completely asymptomatic and had never had heart issues had his tracing done. It was not what we were expecting. We discovered his heart rate was 144 and the device suggested \"Possible A Fib\". We were very concerned and repeated the tracing several times with the same results. This device is not a doctor but it can tell you when to call your doctor or go to the Emergency Department. So my cousins husband did not take it lightly and had further testing done which revealed he had 4 cardiac arteries blocked. His widow maker was 100% blocked!! He underwent quadruple bypass surgery and has recovered nicely. He was completely asymptomatic and we truly believe that this device saved his life. Thanks AliveCor!! We are firm believers in your device and so glad that it is available to the public.",

        "comment": "I am extremely glad to have an Alivecor to check my heart rhythm to determine whether or not I am in Afib.  I appreciate the capability to email the readings to myself at a different email and print the readings to share with my doctor.  He does not do email.   I like being able to record the activity before the reading or how I feel.  I am now enrolled in a cardiac study at Johns Hopkins Hospital.  They are giving the volunteers an Alivecor to take readings and able to be monitored by the study staff.  I figure Johns Hopkins has confidence in Alivecor.  Three cons with Alivecor.  First, I wish the phone case was a bit stronger to protect the phone.  Second, there should be more detail in the analysis.  There are three choices, Normal, Unclassified and Possible Atrial Fibrillation.  I understand Normal and Possible Atrial Fibrillation.  I don't understand Unclassified.  There may be some limits imposed by the FDA.  However, I would like to know some of the parameters that might fall under Unclassified.  I have figured out that Unclassified may include bradycardia beats under 49 bpm and tachycardia, beats over 100 bpm.  Not sure if I am correct.  What is included in Unclassified between those numbers?  Third, the response to emails for diagnosis do not contain enough detail.  Responses seem like canned messages.  These are minor.  The device provides confidence knowing I am in rhythm. details for my doctor when not in rhythm.",

        "comment": "My wife and I live in Rio Vista, Ca. Her cardiologist advised us to buy the AliveCor device because of her SVT attacks. Several months later, in October 6, 2016, she had what she thought was a bad SVT attack. We used the AliveCor with the Kardia app and it indicated she was in AFib. She was hospitalized two days because of its severity, but no heart attack. Cut to Nov 9, 2016, around 8:40 in Palm Springs. I'm using my smartphone, when I experience burning indigestion discomfort. Take anti acid, but it worsens. Feel pulse in carotid and it's erratic. Use the AliveCor and it registered unclassified, three times in 5 minutes. I know what my normal ECG looks like and knew I was in trouble. I called 911, EMT arrives 5 minutes later, does their thing and 10-15 minutes,  I'm in the hospital heart attack. Within another 25 minutes or less, I'm have an angioplasty procedure to remove a 90 percent blockage to the Left Anterior Descending. Little to no heart damage. I can't say enough about the AliveCor. It has already saved my wife's life and mine. \nRecommended Improvement:\nCurrently the device reads Normal, AFib or Unclassifief. I'd like to see a Possible STEMI, or Possible Heart Attack reading. \nI talked up AliveCor before this happened, but now I'm telling everyone in their 60s to consider purchasing it. One other thing. The medical staff in Palm Springs was amazed when I showed them my readings and easily identified PVs and the STEMI.",

        "comment": "I am a Physician Assistant who works in a 30+ bed/24 hour a day urgent care.  In the past 3 years I have seen many patients in \"A fib\".  Many had know idea anything was wrong.  Some came in for anxiety, palpitations, and some for chest pain.  Those who knew were \"paroxysmal\" patients suspecting recurrence.\n\nAs for me, I figured a Pneumonia, and boy was I wrong!!!  Out of the gate I had afib RVR, or \"Rapid Ventricular Response\". In lamens terms, your heart's bottom half is accelerated or accelerates with minimal exertion.  This can lead to V-Tach, venticular (the bottom half) tachicardia, which if left un-treated is a \"lethal rhythm\" as it is known.  Even simpler terms \"not good\" :-)\n\nFor me, I now back in \"Normal Sinus Rythm\" thanks to an electrical cardioversion.  This is where a surgeon or ED doc drugs you up (if you are lucky) and shocks your hear out of A fib (again, if you are lucky you heart complies).  \n\nI now have a history of A fib, and if it happens again to me I will have \"paroxysmal\" A fib.  God forbid it does not convert one day, then Chronic Atrial Fibrillation.\n\nMy low risk at 46 years old and otherwise healthy means I won't take blood thinners most likely.  This means I need to know if I go back into A fib quickly so I can go get shocked right away. The Kardia is going to let me do that by my taking my tracings every couple of days or with suspicion.  \n\nIt is now the most powerful tool in my very recently changed life and I am 5-star grateful to have it!!!",

        "comment": "Like the \"Wizard of Oz\" scene, AliveCor is hoping reviewers focus on the smoke and mirrors of its device and not what's behind the curtain. The device works well enough, and if that's all you base a review on, \"wow it's a 5!\"\n\nBut even more important than taking a recording is reporting those recordings to your doctor, and this is where AliveCor falls on its face.  The reporting capability both online and on your phone a woefully pitiful. Your doctor will laugh at you while cursing AliveCor.\n\nLog onto their website, and the first thing you notice is that the online reporting offers no way to search individual reports - you literally have to scroll through potentially hundreds of readings to find a particular tracing. Your doctor will love that!\n\nWorse, the website inaccurately aggregates reports.  In one test where half the reports were SR-SVE and the other half SR, it failed to list any of the SR-SVE!  Only by scrolling through hundreds of potential tracings can you identify individual results.  Imagine your doctor fiddling around on a website trying to find which recordings to examine?  AliveCor is clearly more focused on the flash of its device than the usefulness of its website to physicians.\n\nI can go on, but you should be getting the point. Most reviewers who have given AliveCor a favorable rating have only focused on the flash of its device.  No one seems to pay attention to what happens when you want your doctor to review those recordings.  \n\n...And that's where AliveCor falls flat on its face.",

        "comment": "Most noticeable is that the AliveCor device contact pads are easily dented and scratched indicating that metal used is dead soft and not of a harder grade metal or plated with a hard coating to make the device more resilient being so exposed.on the back side of a cell phone.  The plastic holder for the AliveCor has two small \"flex bending spring ears\" at the lead-in of the holder if th we AliveCor device is removed from the holder....those spring ears protrude slightly and because they are rounded off and are of a slightly higher profile first one got snagged and broke off then the second one saw the same fate. Now I must watch that I don't lose the AliveCor device altogether. It has already slipped out of the holder and dropped waist high to a hard surface causing me to hope the AliveCor device has some \"g\" shock survivability built into it.  Regarding the output...the waveform displayed shows almost too much sensitivity to the point my Cardiologist has said \"so much background static in the waveform produced that it bordered on almost being useless\".  The Dr is the one who recommended AliveCor and now considers it \"a toy\" and not medical grade enough for him to the point that a Medtronic LINQ Loop recording device was implanted within me at his recommendation. The AliveCor device also responded that a possible AF was recorded when my Cardio Dr. quickly and easily identified the recording as having many PAC's in it indicating with the Dr. now saying that the algorithm programmed within the AliveCor was not able to distinguish between a series of waveforms that were indicative of AF from that of a series of much less harmful PAC's in the recorded series of waveforms. So too many false positive AF feedback.  I have owned and used my AliveCor device since Sept. 4, 2015.",

        "comment": "We live in a very stressful world and life isn't getting easier. \r\n\r\nI've been to the ER more than once because of episodes of tachycardia, shortness of breath, elevated BP, a sense of imminent doom: those of us past middle-age and many younger people know the routine. Each time I was there, an EKG was part and parcel of the standard tests they ran to rule out a heart attack. \r\n\r\nNow, I never had a heart attack that they could find or even a mini-stroke. But I worry a lot and that's just the way I am. When I heard about Alive Cor's device, I was curious but held off because it was being promoted as a tool to help those afflicted with diagnosed AFIB. And my physicians have never found AFIB. So, it seemed logically contradictory and also a waste of $99 to buy one. But I did. \r\n\r\nAnd I this is only the second day of owning it, but I feel better. Aside from having a family history of stroke and sleep apnea, worrying about the possible scenarios and consequences just made me feel bad, even though nothing was really wrong.\r\n\r\nWhat the KardiaMobile provides me with is the assurance that I can check if I feel a little \"off\" to see if I have a normal EKG or not. I can have a history of my normal EKG's on file to compare with any future ones and while the device isn't for self-diagnosis, it can help me to decide whether or not I need to seek further medical assistance. The best part is that the test is quick and you can take as many \"snapshots\" as you want. Alive Cor has changed their policy so that you can save your tests for yourself at no additional cost. The only fault I found seemed to be based in the newest version of Android software. I was unable to record any voice notations. All I got was a loud hiss and jumbled words. So I turned that \"feature\" off until they fix it. \r\n\r\nBut be assured, being able to rule out AFIB, which can affect anyone or to just be able to check for a \"normal\" EKG goes along way in helping affected people or worriers like me feel better. Well worth the small investment.",

        "comment": "AFIB AND TRICKINESS TO GET READINGS. Afib is a heart condition, that I watched my mother struggle with.  Unfortunately she was unaware of what was happening as her mental condition was deteriorating.  Afib is also sporadic and  unless a doctor sets you up on a holter monitor for the span of time it is happening, you never get proof. With an event monitor, you need to know the Afib is happening.  I also found, a typical home style blood pressure cuff cannot accurately detect the erratic heart rate that Afib presents.  You get a error.  Manually you can measure it, but unless you are a nurse  you may not know how to do this accurately. I am not a nurse.  ALIVECOR APP IMPRESSED MY DOCTORS: The Alivecor app and device is literally a life saving option.  If you think you have Afib, you just whip out the sensor (I dont have mine attached to my phone) and start your app and you get a reading.  I had suspected I had Afib, but my primary physician was thinking it was all in my head.  I knew better having researched my Moms condition.  I purchased this monitor and showed my doctor the readings I was getting and finally I was referred to a heart doctor. She was amazed at the technology and felt it was compelling.  This is essential.  Afib can cause strokes and if you get it under control and on a blood thinner you may well avoid any complications.    My heart doctor was enthusiastic to see the readings.  He loved that not only did you get the info, but you also got the trace.  I even managed to get a trace where I converted from Afib back into sinus rhythm. That was useful as there is sometimes issues with this.  I am now being treated for this condition and have scads of data besides the extra tests the doctor put me through.  I feel I can manage my condition as an individual.   SETUP AND USAGE: I downloaded the app and put it in record mode and the first trace was sent to validate the unit and I was ready to go.  I found you cant use it, when it is plugged in and also if you move too much it will mess up the trace.  Occasionally it takes a moment to start a reading, but I have found finger position matters and a few times I had to restart my phone.  Thank you Alivecor.",

I only returned mine because I have a Pixel 6 and the volume buttons are to low on the side/almost centered. That is a Pixel design flaw because all clamp phone accessories to be balanced smash the buttons down. Do to Google's flaw of button placement the clamp had to be placed lower causing the phone to be unbalanced. My older Samsung Phones worked perfectly fine with the gimbal.Will repurchase another one when I get new phone with normal button placement.",

You get what you pay for. \n\nI also love their app and all of the many features it has. The app also has step-by-step tutorial videos. Took some time to learn & some practice. Definitely worth having though. I bought it for my business.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Great gimbal for a beginner such as myself. I originally wanted to get the OM6 but realized I'm not a pro, nor a consistent video maker so the OM SE fit my criteria. The benefit is that it has some features from the OM6 such as the active track 5.0 and some physical buttons on the gimbal itself. Only gripe is that the gimbal cannot go a full degree of motion on certain angles but that seems to be the case for most gimbals anyways in this price range.",

        "comment": "Read the instructions!  I'm staying at a hotel and discarded everything but the mouse and battery before I went inside.  The mouse worked at first but stopped working when I rebooted, and wouldn't work in my 2nd installation of Windows 10 on the same laptop, nor on Windows 10 on my ARM-based Samsung.  After 15 minutes of scratching my head, I finally realized that you need to press and HOLD (not simply turn on) the Bluetooth button for the computer to see, pair with, and connect with the mouse.  Then it comes up instantly as Bluetooth Mobile Mouse 3600 and stays connected after rebooting.\n\nOne minor complaint is that you can't easily switch the mouse between two running instances of Windows on separate laptops.  What happens is that the mouse will connect to one and remain paired on the other.  There is no way to reconnect without clicking \"Remove device\" and holding the button again.  After all of these years, Bluetooth still feels like a half-baked technology, at least in Windows.  You would think Microsoft would put a \"Reconnect to paired device\" in the Bluetooth settings.\n\nI wish the mouse came in exciting colors like cinnabar red or Persian green or zaffre blue.  Black is so boring.\n\nFor me, when rebooting, there is a brief, almost unnoticeable loss of connectivity immediately after logging into Windows when the Bluetooth icon first appears in the system tray.\n\nI bought this particular mouse for 3 reasons:\n\n(1) My favorite mouse in terms of comfort and precision is Microsoft Mobile Mouse 4000 so I wanted to try another Microsoft product.  I find most Logitech mice too complex and unwieldy at the high end, and too flimsy and plasticky at the low end, and haven't found my personal Goldilocks with their mice.  \n\n(2) The back of the box says this mouse is compatible with Windows 10, macOS from 10.10.3 onward, and Android from 4.4.2 onward.  No mention of iOS or iPad but 3 out of 4 is pretty impressive.\n\n(3) My much-despised ThinkPad T480 company laptop only has two USB 2.0 ports and a tiny (for me at least) M.2 SSD.  I'm often working with massive files and folders as a cell site tech.  Up until I bought the Bluetooth Mobile Mouse 3600, every time I needed to transfer data from one external USB hard drive to another (because there's not enough room on the internal SSD), I had to disconnect my Microsoft Mobile Mouse 4000 and use the dreaded, glitchy trackpad or (gasp) the red nubby snazzlefrazzum and I would sometimes inadvertently move dozens of folders to the wrong locations or delete entire folder trees in an unintended fatfinger calypso dance.  The bluetooth mouse solved this problem for me brilliantly.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] As a user of the earlier-generation OM4 smartphone gimbal, I am incredibly impressed with the OM6.  It's a worthy upgrade (even if you don't really have the need to extend the \"selfie-stick\").  Slimmer and lighter with better controls than the previous generation OM4, the OM6 feels good in the hand and works intuitively once you get the hang of the custom controls.\n\nWithin a few minutes of having the gimbal out of the box, I had it working with the app on my iPhone 13 Pro Max (yes it fits in the clamp and the gimbal motors are more than a match for my phone and it's case).  I'm glad they did away with the adhesive mount and only include the clamp.  The clamp holds on tight and is easy to attach and remove without sticking around to ruin your wireless charging plans.  This is another big improvement over the OM4.  I had the OM6 smoothly following our cat around the living room.\n\nThere are so many shot options in the app, but the ability to select and follow a subject and the ability to sit the gimbal on its included tripod (or another full-sized tripod with the threaded mount) and take time-lapse video are my favorites.\n\nStabilization is as smooth as you'd want, even with a big phone and battery life is everything I need - I never ran out of juice in my testing.  The USB-C charging is also very fast, so even if you do manage to run it dry, you won't be waiting long.\n\nIf you're in the market for a gimbal for your phone, it's hard to find any reason not to recommend the OM6.  I use a larger DJI RSC2 for my mirrorless camera, but with mobile camera video quality and portability, I prefer to reach for my phone and the OM6 when I can.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The design of the DJI Osmo 6 is thoughtful. The body feels to be made of a plastic which I imagine would be good for shock absorption but may lead to some durability issues if not treated with care. It folds which is great for portability. While the device could probably fit in a pocket, l think that it fits better in a small bag, purse, or backpack. The controls are well placed and feel very comfortable for one-handed use.  The joystick feels precise. The extendable selfie stick is really useful—especially when trying to get a group shot.\n\nThe magnetic phone holder is another really nice touch. It allows for quick placement and removal on the phone, which is great for situations where you would need to do that like reviewing footage between takes. I didn’t try any of the accessories but they look like they would be nice upgrades.\n\nThe gimbal itself is powerful and makes a huge difference in shot stabilization. If you are shooting in conditions with a lot of movement this is going to offer a serious improvement. Using the joystick to pan is super smooth as well.\n\nThere are a ton of great features included with this product; the most valuable (to me) being the ActiveTrack 5.0. Simply put, the device in conjunction with the app is able to “lock on” to the video’s subject while filming. It works amazing and gives a very specific effect to the content which is heavily featured on Tiktok, Instagram, and other social media platforms. \n\nThe DJI Mimo app is amazing. It works as intended and adds a lot of functionality to the device. I tested it with my iPhone but it works with Android as well. \n\nOverall this is a great device. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a gimbal with great tracking and a number of features.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’ve been considering getting a system like this for awhile.  Particularly for vacations when I want to do videos and those selfies with the wife in nice locations where you don’t necessarily want to go looking for someone to take photos for you.  Overall, the Osmo is easy to setup.  No complications that I recall.  The phone holder looks unassuming and almost too light for the task.  So far though, it’s held my iPhone 13 Pro Max, in case, without issue.  Don’t know that I would try this setup hanging from a vehicle or anywhere where the motion of the carrier would be excessive.  Using the controls is easy but does take some getting used to.  More because this is my first time with a device like this so remember what button to multi-click, to do what, is taking some time.  With more use I’m sure it’ll be muscle memory though.  The tracking feature is nice, but could use some work.  It seems to track me fine if I move from side to side in the shot.  If I standup from a desk position though, it does not tilt enough to keep my face in view.  Not a deal breaker, just something to be mindful of and plan accordingly for.  It’s great they include the tripod, instead of making it an accessory that has to be purchased separately.  It would be awesome if they could find a way to incorporate a tripod in the handle though, so you don’t have to worry about keeping track of that extra item.  I haven’t used it enough to speak to battery life.  The extension is good, but for me it could probably use one more section.  The extension should help get some nice low angle shots.  It is a little bulky.  I think the marketing stuff showing this in folks front pockets is a bit laughable.  It is a good size for a backpack or camera bag though.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The DJI Osmo 6 is an amazing phone gimbal.  I have been using an Osmo 2 for the last few years but the Osmo 6 is a serious upgrade to my previous model.  \n\nSetup takes less than a few minutes, you download the DJI Mimo and pair it with your smartphone and you’re off and ready to go.  A nice new feature of the osmo 6 is that when you unfold it it automatically turns on.  If you need to start recording quickly that is a great feature.  The holder for the phone is magnetic and will stretch wide enough so that you can leave your phone in a case, which my previous osmo could not do.  The osmo will also automatically open up the Mimo app upon connection!  The stabilizer for the phone is much more fluid and stronger than previous models.  Sometimes with my osmo 2 if I didn’t have the phone balanced in the right spot it would kind of flop over and be non functional.  I didn’t experience that at all with the new osmo 6, even with the added weight of a case.  The active track 5.0 is phenomenal and allows you to stay focused on a face or object.  The osmo will keep it in focus the entire time no matter which way you turn it.  They’ve also added the ability to extend the osmo with a retractable arm that will allow you to get more people in the frame or get lower to the ground effortlessly.  The osmo also has 4 shooting modes: Follow, which follows the gimbals pan and tilt movements.  Tilt locked, which only uses the gimbals pan movements.  FPV mode, which utilizes all 3 axes of the gimbal which is the mode I use the most for Real Estate video walkthroughs.  Spinshot utilities the joystick to rotate the camera to make dynamic footage.  Finally there’s a new side wheel which allows you to zoom in and out effortlessly while recordings. All of these features combine for a very good phone gimbal.  I highly recommend the osmo for anyone who needs an inexpensive gimbal to stabilize photos or video.  It really is one of the best products that DJI makes in my opinion.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is a rather impressive piece of hardware.  The folding/unfolding mechanism, magnets to attach the phone and stretch phone mount make it easy to attach your phone and get up and running quickly.  The gimbals and motors really do keep the phone steady/the video stable and it can track people which is a nice touch.  The joystick also moves the phone just where you want it smoothly without jerking and the buttons give you rapid control to start/stop recording, flip the phone from portrait to landscape and other key features.  It also feels good in the hand with a good heft and solid feel without being too heavy which is huge.\n\nWhere it lets down a bit (for Android users at least) is on the software side.  Due to a dispute with Google (and, to some degree, the US government), DJI's app is not available on the Google Play store, and must be downloaded and \"sideloaded\" from their website.  This means that you must enable installing non-Play Store apps in the security settings of your phone, turning off one of the security features of Android (with that setting turned off, it will let you install - purposefully or not - apps from ANY source).  It's also a setting that some corporate environments require you to keep enabled.  So, for Android users at least, this is an issue.  \n\nOnce you get the software installed, either on Android or iOS (where it is found in the Apple App Store), it's a pretty nice experience, giving you quick tutorials on the major features and letting you use some of the buttons to control the phone directly (it guides you through pairing the phone and the gimbal).  Overall, the software is a big plus for the device - BUT I do wish it was directly available in Google's Play Store (DJI, can you work on that!)\n\nAll told, this is a really nice package (with the one caveat about Android users) for those looking to get better video, but still looking to use their smartphones/not invest in an expensive dedicated camera.  You can shoot cinematic looking videos easily and be the envy of all your followers - which is the goal, right?",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] While initially slightly disappointed in the included 'instruction manual', it was made up for by following the QR code and going where I needed.  That'll be an .apk download you'll have to give your phone permission for, but the app is super helpful.  Well that and it's very nearly mandatory for complete, proper use of the gimbal.\nBecause of that, I feel that the app is integral to using this device and needs to be brought up in the review.\nThe device itself is sturdy and has a good weight to it.  Most of the controls will be in easy reach of most users, with only the zoom/focus wheel posing any kind of problem for those with shorter thumbs.  Along those lines, it does seem to be designed heavily toward right-handed use, and that may just be a statistical design choice.  The magnet on the phone clamp feels strong and left no worries that the phone would drop from the gimbal, and the arm is strong enough to hold likely any phone currently on the market.  Controls are simple to use and grasp once you know what they mean, and that's where the app really shines.\nAs stated, the app is pretty much mandatory for proper use, as it connects via bluetooth to join your phone and the gimbal.  Without it, most of the buttons don't properly function, if they do anything at all.  The app, aside from granting full use of the device, grants full use of all camera controls by using the camera through the app.  It also contains a number of templates and such to help make quick movies, with direction on how to set them up and pull the shots you need.  Speaking of direction, you should find your way to the tutorial videos included within the app, as they give a step by step breakdown on how to use the device, what each of the settings mean and are capable of, and how to make the most out of your new accessory.\nAside from the instruction manual issue, my only gripe is that I have to remove my case every time I want to put my phone in the gimbal, as I couldn't get it to function well with the case on--it seems to throw off the motors and the magnet.\n\nOverall, 4.75/5.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] DJI have some of the best drones on the planet. What happens when they take that gimbal technology and introduce it to cell phones? You get smooth video footage in a compact package without breaking the bank in the Osmo Mobile 6.\nI was expecting a much larger piece of equipment. However, this thing is relatively small.  When closed and in the storage position, it is about an inch longer than an iPhone 12 ProMax. It includes tripod feet that screw into the bottom for hands free self-recording. The mount is a standard ¼-20 screw mount that is found on all current photography tripod so you can even use one of those to hold the gimbal and phone for recording. The phone clamp is quite strong an holds the iPhone 12 ProMax with ease to the gimbal with a very strong magnet that will not allow the phone to drop. Also included in the box is a USB cord to charge the internal battery and a suede pouch to keep everything together.\nThe first thing that caught my attention is the quick on feature built into the device. Once you unlock the lock that keeps it from flopping around in an off state and flip up the arm the device turns itself on. This save seconds that could be used to capture the action sooner.\nThe Osmo mobile 6 has four modes for how the gimbal operates. They are Follow, Tilt Lock, FPV and Spin Shot. For most Vlogging scenarios Follow mode is the most used. \nThe DJI Mimo app that is paired with the Osmo has several tutorials that will get you familiar with the use and functions. Also, there are tutorials for shooting specific scenes.\nSome the newer features of this model that differ from the previous version and a smooth operating side wheel for zoom or focus. With a press of the side wheel, you can select either the zoom or the focus function. Another nice, upgraded feature is the joystick control that allows for smooth panning. The third feature is a screen that shows which mode the gimbal is set to.\nOverall if you are looking for a device to get smoother video footage out of your phones camera this thing is great. If you already have a capable smart phone and want to get into vlogging or just shooting more video with your phone that can look more professional, this is probably what you are looking for. \nAll in all another great product from DJI.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is my first smartphone gimbal, so I was super excited to get this Osmo 6 version and try it out.  After a little bit of a learning curve, I love this thing!\n\nRight out of the box, you’ll notice that hard copy instructions or quick start guide material is lacking.  For iOS users at least, that’s not a problem because you simply scan the included QR code and the app store takes you right to the DJi app to download, and the app immediately recognizes the Osmo 6 as the item you’re using, and begins walking you step by step through all the initial setup process, and explaining all the features along the way, in both text and videos.  The app tutorial is quite impressive.\n\nIt uses a super strong magnet base attachment for your phone, that easily expands to fit large phones with cases.  I’m using an iPhone 14 Pro Max with an Otterbox case, and it has no trouble fitting inside the expanding base attachment.  This then secures to the Osmo 6 with a strong magnet, allowing you to securely shoot your videos and photos, and remove your phone in a snap at any moment.  The magnet is strong enough that I have no worries at all about the phone coming off the mount.\n\nControls are perfectly placed no matter which hand you use to shoot with. You have controls for tilting and panning, quick access to front or rear cameras, zoom and manual focus control, preset modes for different shooting styles and a trigger for activating follow mode, to stay locked on to your subject as you or they move around.  Also the buttons have double click features that allow extended options like flipping from portrait to landscape mode in a breeze, or re-centering the gimbal.  It also has a tripod stand for table top placement and a built in extension rod.\n\nIt uses it’s own DJi app for the video and photo controls, which I haven’t had a problem with.  You get more controls over the aspects of your shots compared to Apple’s built in camera app, and you have the ability to customize things like ISO, Shutter Speed, Resolution and FPS, etc.  The controls are pretty intuitive and easy to use, and the 3 axis stabilization really shows in your final videos.  Everything is super smooth and centered, so much better than just using a traditional phone holder or selfie stick.  The learning curve for me was adjusting to the “non” movement of the camera angles that I’m accustomed too, based on body and hand movements while filming.  Letting the gimbal offer precise balance and stabilization is wonderful, it just takes a little getting used to in order to perfect your shooting style with it.  So much fun to play with.\n\nIt has a sold build, and pretty lightweight, not overly heavy, and folds down to a respectable size for travel.\n\nI don’t know that I ever want to shoot mobile video without a gimbal again, and the Osmo Mobile 6 has been the perfect tool for me so far.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] If you’re looking to up your photography or videography using your mobile device, this stabilizer will help you accomplish that! Working the best with the DJI MIMO App and an iPhone, you’ll find you get some amazing features with this gimbal stabilizer. You get 3-axis stabilization, a built-in extension rod, and ActiveTrak 5.0 allowing you to track even the most difficult subjects and keep them in frame. \n\nUnboxing you’ll find the main Osmo Mobile 6, the magnetic phone clamp, the tripod, charging cable, and a little storage pouch. Getting the Osmo Mobile 6 setup is very simple. Download the DJI MIMO App and it will pair via Bluetooth to your phone and walk you through tutorials on how to operate the different features and modes of the device. While you can utilize the gimbal without connecting to the DJI MIMO App, you do lose some functions like ActiveTrak, switching between cameras, switching shooting modes (photo/video), using the focus or zoom wheel, or using the record button. The functions of the gimbal continue to work, but obviously any feature that relies on communication to your phone becomes very limited. \n\nOverall, the DJI Osmo Mobile 6 has a ton of features to allow flexibility and get you professional looking stabilized footage. With ActiveTrak, not only can you make sure your subject stays perfectly centered in frame, you can also use the included stand and have the gimbal follow you around even if you’re shooting something by yourself. This is a huge advantage if you’re a content creator on the go and use your phone a lot to shoot footage. The built-in tripod mount is also a huge advantage allowing the ultimate flexibility for whatever mount you need to connect the Osmo to. On top of all of those features, the gimbal will also extend into a selfie-stick. \n\nThe different gimbal modes give you a good amount of flexibility on which axis you want to lock down or prioritize. You have Follow mode which will lock your orientation angle but allow you to pan up, down, left, and right. The second mode is Tilk Lock, which will only follow your left or right panning. If you need to pan up or down, you will use the joystick on the Osmo. The 3rd mode is FPV mode which will unlock all 3 axes. Not only will you get panning, the camera will now be allowed to change it’s orientation angle. The final mode is SpinShot allowing you to control the orientation angle using the joy stick. For me, I found the 1st mode the most natural, while modes 2 and 3 allowed some flexibility depending on what shot I was attempting to achieve. \n\nIn conclusion, if you’re needing a compact, feature rich gimbal stabilizer, you don’t need to look further. DJI is a leader in image stabilization from their gimbals to their drones. They make great products and back them with good customer service. I’ve seen some users report issues or limited functionality using Android devices, but I’m confident DJI will be able to fix those bugs moving forward. For the best experience, pairing with an iPhone and the DJI MIMO App will not leave you disappointed.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] As a first time user of a gimbal I was very impressed upon opening the box to find the DJI Osmo Mobile 6 Stabilizer has a high quality look and feel. Inside the box you'll find a brief instruction booklet tucked inside a suede holding pouch, the gimbal, a phone clip magnetic stabilizer unit, a mount grip attachable tripod and a charging cable. You must provide your own charger and I simply used my Apple iPad model which worked perfectly.\n\nI then downloaded the DJI MIMO app and was pleased to see it offers a Beginner's Guide plus Tutorials which are really helpful for a gimbal newbie such as myself. There was a firmware update V01.00.02.40 that went in after I connected my iPhone 12 Pro Max via Bluetooth (which worked flawlessly) and placed in the phone clip stabilizer unit, then attached it to the gimbal. \n\nThere are various function buttons on the gimbal, a battery indicator and also a built in extension rod for taking those low shots or views from above your subject or just because the scene calls for it. This rod pulls out from right above the settings area. The app is set to come on automatically when I attach the phone, a super nice feature. When you want to turn the gimbal off simply remove the phone, flip it down into a folding position and it's off. It's small enough to easily carry and the pouch will keep it safe.\n\nAnother great feature is the Active Track 5.0. I have a 2 year old granddaughter and was so excited to have her over to try this out! Oh my gosh the stabilization went perfectly and the video of her and my daughter is a real keepsake! With the Osmo 6 you have none of the jerky, annoying quirks you get if just holding the phone in your hands, especially action shots. Believe me my granddaughter gave me plenty of running around for action! The videos I took look very professional too!\n\nWe also rent out a B&B property on 15 acres of land and I can't wait to use this for filming out there when we reopen in spring. A virtual tour should look amazing online, especially with all the nature scenery around. This gimbal is perfect for any real estate or scenery usage in my opinion.\n\nI also did straight PHOTO shooting for my online antiques, collectibles and jewelry store. I love how you can zoom in on jewelry marks by using the side wheel (left side). Press once and it controls focus or turn the wheel so it zooms in and out on your object. I found it so much easier to spend time photographing my various items using the Osmo gimbal than doing it freehand with my digital camera. The gimbal is pretty lightweight therefore my arm did not get tired nor did I have to twist and turn my body to get that perfect shot like when using the camera. There is also the tripod which was attached and for some of the shots that was the way to go. Everything turned out wonderful!\n\nThere is a joystick to control the direction and an M button to switch between portrait and landscape modes and also to use the front or back cameras. Other features are available but I suggest you definitely watch videos on YouTube about the DJI Stabilizer for tips, tricks and usage. There are a number out there and all seem very informative. Of course you have the built in app videos which are extremely helpful, especially if you are new to gimbals.\n\nThis is an item I wasn't sure about liking, even though I photograph tons of things. But after using it the last few days I must say now it's indispensable! When I go in to shoot pics it's the first thing I grab in my photography room. From class act videos to photos, the DJI Mobile 6 Stabilizer does it all, works beautifully and is a delight to use! I highly recommend it!",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is essentially a gimbal for your cell phone camera. Sure, I've used my cell phones and action cameras over the years for pictures and video, and I've done quite a bit of work using tripods and lighting rigs, but this is the first mechanical stabilizer I've used.  This is way more than just a selfie stick, it has all kinds of capabilities to fundamentally change the way you capture video and images. It was a pretty steep learning curve for me to get used to how it works and how to use its functionality, but I feel like I started thinking like a movie cameraman.  It's just a wildly different experience to have this device control the actual positioning and tracking of the camera and video.\nThe app is full of guides and tutorials, so there's lots and lots of learning material right there available to you. It even can offer suggestions for how you create certain effects and how you use its features.  So yeah for me it was scary to take on this whole new skillset but the app can guide you every step of the way.  I'm still learning and getting the hang of how its features can enhance the content that I create.\nOtherwise this little machine is extremely well built, the motors really do their job positioning that phone in three axes, and it's pretty quiet and the battery lasts a good long time",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] As a stabilizer, this thing rocks.  Videos come out very stable and the stabilizer does a good job accounting for your movements.  It folds down very small and comes with a magnetic phone gripper and legs and storage bag.  If you are lucky to have a phone that you can put the phone grip on in the middle of the phone and have a perfectly balanced phone in the stabilizer, you will have no problems.  If you are unfortunate to have a phone where if you put the phone grip in the middle of the phone in a balanced position, you might have the phone grip constantly putting pressure on the volume button or power button.  Luckily, the gripper opens up big enough that it can be placed over my Google Pixel 7 Pro in a Spigen Tough Armor case and avoids pressing the volume down button.  Instructions are very lacking in the box and will take time to fumble around to figure out how to use it.  The DJI app is not in the Google Play store thanks to embargos, so you have to manually download and install it yourself.  Once you have the app installed and paired with the stabilizer, the app walks you through the entire feature set. Overall, if you can get your phone onto this stabilizer without any buttons being pushed, you will be very happy with the performance of this stabilizer.  Of all the knockoff stabilizers I have tried, DJI really did an amazing job and is well worth the price if you need stable videos.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I can't say enough wonderful things about the DJI Osmo Mobile 6 stabilizer. All that is required is to download the app onto your phone and you're ready to start creating videos. \n\nLet's discuss the features. The first feature of course is the stabilizing feature. It does a great job at keeping the camera steady as I even had my daughter hold the camera and check out how well it stabilized. Okay, that's just one little feature. Another great feature is with the app open, you can set the stabilizer up to actively track someone or something. I first tried the feature on a cat (The cat wasn't amused), then I tried the feature on myself just walking around the house, and the stabilizer tracked perfectly (It was a little slow but very smooth). The app itself has so many different features that I can't even list them all, as I'm continuously learning about them as I use the stabilizer. Another great thing about the stabilizer and the app is that as you access new features it gives you simple step-by-step tutorials to follow, which makes learning how to use the stabilizer a breeze. \n\nOverall, I'm super impressed with it, from the active track to the features on the app itself. This is a great product!",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] While great for TikTok videos & vertical filming, the horizontal vlogging while tilted is bad. Tilt motion is limited making walking vlogs with the front facing camera a challenge. Also you can only selfie film yourself using the front facing camera. The camera would often lose track of me and I constantly had to readjust. It doesn’t have the full range of motion which I need for outdoor filming. Vertical movements from the top to bottom shows the flaw in the design. The quick setup is great. It’s very light but sturdy. I like the built in selfie stick, and the software is pretty good. You really need to think ahead about what type of filming you’ll do as this unit has a lot of great features. The issue is that it doesn’t meet my needs and after getting a gimbal where I can vlog myself using the rear facing camera I realize that this unit is not for me. It’s not a bad product, but you really need to know what your needs are before buying a gimbal to film. In certain situations this product is perfect. It really is a well made good product depending on what you need to accomplish with your filming.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I am not a professional photographer, but I am a bit of a photography enthusiast.  I mostly focused on still images mainly because handheld video is never easy to get right.  \n\nSo this is the first gimbal I have ever used and I must say I am very impressed.  Video while moving is super steady and the ability to track targets is incredibly useful.  Still coming up with different ways to use this feature as it opens up so many possibilities.\n\nIn the box you get the gimbal, phone clip and tripod and charging cable\n\nOut of the box, set up is easy and intuitive - scan a QR code and download an app, pair the gimbal with Bluetooth.  The app offers lots of training for newbies like myself via tutorial videos.  And you pick up a lot just by experimenting with the different features.  \n\nPhysical controls are in easy to use places, and the wheel for zoom and button for swapping between stills and video are very useful.  The gimbal is well balanced and ergonomically designed.\n\nThis is an easy device to recommend to anyone wanting to take their cell phone videos to the next level.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Yes. I'm an Android enthusiast. My Samsung S22 Ultra is a great phone, but I understand Apple gets a lot of the third party compatibility. Maybe that's due to the fragmentation of Android. Who knows? But I really don't appreciate companies that claim to be compatible with Android who are not truly compatible. This DJI Osmo Mobile 6 is a perfect example of that. Apple has an official app you can find in their app store, but Android is left with an APK (that my anti-virus program warned me about downloading) that needs to be side loaded. There needs to be more effort in labeling this on the box and in the product description. However, it still works for stabilizing, just don't think you'll be able to take advantage of all the zoom features and controlling options the stabilizer has. Luckily, I am mainly using it for family memories, so my Scorsese skills in film making will not need a lot of these controls. But I'd love for it to be available if the product is priced the same no matter if it all works or not. It'd be nice to have an Android edition, that may lack all features, but would be cheaper. The build quality is excellent though. Not too heavy, but hefty enough to feel the quality materials used. All in all, I'm glad I own it because as a stabilizer it works well. I just wish it was truly compatible with Android officially.",

        "comment": "This is a solid and portable gimble, from its hardware to its mobile app! It has a slight learning curve but is very easy to grasp. \n\nYou will have a wide range of stable and directional control for your videos/photos, and the extender arm and the tripod attachment make it a bonus for hitting those angles or those POV and selfie shots. \n\nI am also impressed with the thumb access to all of those buttons to trigger all of your iPhone's video and photo features without using the touchscreen. It is a very efficient and well-thought-out user experience. It would also be great if the trigger finger button could be customized as the video record or photo snapshot button.\n\nMy only gripe is the MagSafe clamp for iPhones using a protective case, as it could interfere with your buttons and continuously trigger them. It takes a little finesse, and it depends on your protective case, but you might be able to avoid it. Centering the MagSafe clamp is not difficult once you have done it a few times.\n\nIn some cases, you might need to offset the positioning of the clamp to avoid button triggering, which could also affect the gimble's auto-balancing feature in landscape mode. The gimble may also use more battery life to maintain its balance during landscape mode.\n\nHowever, if you still have button/balancing issues with the DJI MagSafe clamp, I came across a perfect adapter mount if you Google \"DJI magnetic ring holder phone clamp mount.\" It works perfectly with Magsafe iPhone cases and with the DJI Osmo 6 gimble!",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The DJI Osmo Mobile 6 Stabilizer is one of the coolest products I’ve used in some time. Right out of the set up is super easy, scan the QR code to take you to the app store and download the DJI Mimo App and pair it via Bluetooth. Once in the app there are multiple tutorial videos that help you get familiar with the DJI Osmo Mobile 6, which is a nice feature to have so you're not having to Google or go on Youtube to learn how to properly use this device.  The metal mounting clip is one of the better mounts I have come across, in that it stretches wide enough to grasp around my Iphone 14 Pro Max with a case on, I was for sure thinking that my case was going to be too bulky for it but it was able to. The Mimo software is great in that it basically mimics my iPhone’s camera interface but with some more options on the screen depending on which setting you are in, such as in photo mode where there is a shutter timer where you can pick from 3 seconds, 5 seconds and 7 seconds. In the Video mode it allows you to pick the resolution (720P,1080P or 4K) and what frame rate you would like to shoot in, which is super nice being able to pick that right from the camera interface and not having to dive into the setting to find it. Then the most outstanding feature of the DJI Osmo Mobile 6 has to be the head tracking feature in that when shooting video, a green box shows up and the arm will literally move and follow your head as you move which is perfect for filming things such as content or family videos. The buttons on the DJI Osmo Mobile 6 are very intuitive in that you get a Zoom knob, a record button, a focus stick that allows you to move the arm like you would with the right stick on a game controller, and A landscape to vertical button. There is a trigger button on the back of the handle that is not as intuitive and I highly recommend watching all the tutorial videos to learn all of its little tricks. In summary I think this is one of the best filming accessories you can buy to truly get the best photos and videos on your cell phone.",

If you have the OM5 model and you don't think the zoom button is something useful for you, than no need for upgrades. Otherwise, if you don't have phone stabilizer, definitely buy! Very noob friendly and useful for great content!",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] As a mobile platform gimble, this phone option is amazing.  From the various options provided within the initial presets to aide in learning how to setup, use, and take the best images and videos.  Mobile photo and videos have taken over normal photography options with what’s being made avail today.  Find my normal camera spends more time in it’s carrying bag these days when want that quick shot, my mobile is my go to.  It does take a little bit to set this up for first use with a firmware update during the initial setup.  Once past this and going through the various training videos provided within the app, some calibration to support the phone better (Samsung and Pixel Pro), thigs got only better.  This is very responsive in hold to movement for vertical and horizontal filming.  For first timer’s, this may seem a little overwhelming going through the initial steps depending on how familiar you are with what you’re presented.  For those with experience and/or knowledge, should walk through fairly easily from adding the app to your mobile device, establishing the Bluetooth connection, and getting to the operational play state.  Setup and play time took appox. 30 minutes due avid background with DJI product, other gimbals, and photography/video.  Part the time included playing around with all of the options presented to annoying some of my family while out and about taking footage of high-rise buildings.  Someone special had their own paparazzi for a little bit.\n\nThe gimble itself looks and feels very sturdy, easily unlocked and opened for attachment of your mobile device.  The magnet system on this and phone clamp attaches to the phone securely.  Perhaps one of the most notable changes added are the zoom and focus options as they aide you in getting your best shots.  It does telescope out to aide in those 360 degree and weird position footages where you need the extra length to capture appropriately.  I would highly recommend this for any new or current photographer looking for something to use with their mobile device.\n\nTo note, had to add one of my own wrist straps and capture cord to hand form my neck in the event I should drop the unit as nothing like this was provided in the box; a foul perhaps with the cost tied to this.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I enjoy creating digital content videos, photos, and reels in my spare time and was fortunate to find the new DJI Osmo Mobile 6 stabilizer. I was using an android and an iPhone to create the content which was fun to shoot on vacations and occasionally use a selfie stick with a remote control. I was so happy when I found the new DJI Osmo 6 Stabilizer which immediately made me realize why the price was set above what I expected for my first experience with the brand. I started with the unboxing of the product and noticed immediately that the luxurious quality of the device was far greater than I ever expected. I saw the various sturdy buttons along with the digital display that provides the status of the device and the type of recording you are set to start. Even the tripod stand was a higher quality of plastic and sturdier than my prior product. \n I was impressed with how strong the magnet was to firmly hold my brand-new iPhone 14 Pro Max which is not a light phone. When I hit the commands to flip my phone from portrait to landscape mode, I was thrilled to see it so quick and effortlessly. I downloaded the DJI application for my smartphones which I saw in the instructions and on the box. I found the setup videos and multiple device instruction videos to be extremely helpful for a newbie to the brand.\nI was able to pair it immediately via Bluetooth with my iPhone and it immediately started the setup process on the DJI Osmo gimble and in the application on my phone. I was like a kid having fun when I tried the various activities they take you through from shooting videos, to choosing a smaller area to target for video and then moved into the photo mode. After completing each task, it would flash a congratulatory type of message to let you know you were doing everything correctly. I was relieved that with so many features available on the device that the simple instructions took away the anxiety of having to learn how to make another accessory compatible with the smartphone I was using. I was able to use the device a couple of days before writing this review, so I found the best aspects of the smooth operating system that was satisfying for taking a chance on this new brand. I have already produced new media content and loved that the video stabilization feature proved to be great at keeping the final video from looking too shaky. I am confident that the Osmo Mobile 6 Stabilizer will be my go-to accessory when I create my special projects and for even fun family events to get everyone in the picture or produce even better videos \nI would highly recommend this product to my friends and family who have smartphones that are compatible with the devices listed on the company’s app and website. I look forward to many adventures with the brand and using their products on my international trips along with content created at home regularly.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Take your videos and even pictures to the next level.  This thing is awesome!  In the box you will find the device, stand, carrying case, and magnet for your phone.  I used this with an iPhone 4 pro and setup was a breeze.  During the app setup there is a quick tutorial that will help you understand how each button functions.  There are many short cuts like pushing certain buttons twice to change from wide or portrait mode.  It will take some time to learn the short cuts and become acclimated with it.  The website also offers guides and tutorials as well. \n\nThe motors that they used for the stabilizer are so smooth.  When recording a video you do not see the camera shake or jitter.  When the motors move there is no sound or jumping.  Its very comfortable to hold for long periods of time or you can even use the provided stand.  The overall feel is very premium and of a high quality. \n\nThe app that you download to use the stabilizer is easy to use.  It also offers different photo/video modes along with tips on how to take great videos.  The app quickly connects to the stabilizer via Bluetooth.  There is also no lag from the app to the stabilizer, everything happens quickly.  \n\nI'm a novice photographer, but this thing is so much fun to use and I can see taking it with me on vacation.  My favorite thing to use is the follow/tracking feature.  I was able to hold the stabilizer and it was able to track my dog running around the house.  I was amazed at how easily and quickly it kept on the dog.  This is by far my favorite feature of the stabilizer.  It will make taking videos a lot of fun and easy.\n\nThis is my first stabilizer and overall I love it!  I cannot wait to show it off to people and use it for videos.  The DJI is worth every penny as it is such a premium device.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The DJI Osmo Mobile 6  Gimbal is a very high quality, well designed mobile stabilizer.\n\nBut as an owner of the Google Pixel 6 I have to point out some of the negatives right from the start.\n\nFirst, the DJI MIMO app is not available in the Google Play Store. In order to download the app you must go into settings and allow download and installation of apps from unknown sources. That’s right, you must download an app from a Chinese company directly, without being verified by Google. This of course is accompanied by a warning that downloading this app may cause harm to your device and other apps on your device.  Not very comforting. In addition, not all features work on Android phones. Each phone model is different and therefore this may vary by device.\n\nAlso, I found that my phone was hotter in the Osmo than it is normally when its in camera mode, and the battery drained much quicker.\n\nOne other issue is the magnetic clip holder. It goes on the Pixel phone on top of the volume switch. If placed exactly in the middle of the phone it presses on the down volume switch and turns the volume all the way down.\n\nThe focus scroll wheel is also not functional with my Pixel phone.\n\nThe device itself is very high quality, very ergonomically designed. It is very well balanced in the hand and does not cause hand fatigue. All buttons and switches are placed within easy reach.\n\nDJI has videos in the app to fully explain the operation of each switch.\n\nIn the box you get the magnetic phone clip, the stabilizer unit, an attachable tripod and a charging cable.\n\nAfter you download the app, the Osmo 6 will automatically turn on when you attach the phone and off when the phone is removed.\n\nOne of my favorite features is face lock while in video. Your phone will lock on your face and follow you around. You can place the phone in the Osmo with the tripod, put it on a flat surface and record yourself while moving, and the camera will follow you. A push of a button will automatically switch between portrait and landscape.\n\nImage stabilization is of course a main reason for buying this device and it performs better than any phone by itself.\n\nThere is a scroll wheel for zooming in and out as well as a button for switching between video and photo.\n\nThere are way too many features to mention, however DJI does a great job of explaining the functions in video and with hints that appear on the screen.\n\nI would love to recommend this device, and I would to any iPhone user. But if you are an Android user I would weigh the positives and negatives before purchasing. I don’t know why DJI has put Android users in this situation and I hope that this situation changes sooner rather than later. This could easily be a5 start review if not for the software issues for Android.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Osmo Mobile 6 is a very fun smartphone gimbal stabilizer packed with great features to help you capture smooth, creative footage and fun photos. I like that a lot of what the gimbal has to offer is right at my finger tips. Changing modes, camera orientation, and angles is a click of a button or a push of the joystick away from personal customization. Each mode focuses on customizing which axis has priority over the movement of the camera. More on the modes below.\n\nDJI MIMO APP\nTo get the most out of the DJI Osmo Mobile 6, I suggest downloading the DJI Mimo app which allows you to use all the buttons to their fullest potential. Using the DJI Mimo app will unlock these additional button or handle features:\nSwitch between front and back camera\nSwitch between photo and video mode\nUse the focusing or zoom wheel\nUse the record button\n\nThe features listed above are not available to use with my Google Pixel Camera App. Here are the Osmo Mobile 6 buttons or handle features you can use WITHOUT the Mimo app (say like with your phone’s native camera app, these will just inherently work if the gimbal is on and the phone is mounted properly): \nJoystick\nSwitching between Landscape or Portrait orientation\nChanging Modes\nRe-centering with trigger button\nUsing the trigger to “lock” the view\n\nThe DJI Mimo app is very neat. I really like the subject-follow feature because it essentially allows you to set the camera down and let the app/camera follow your movement even without handling the gimbal itself. This is possible with the included mountable tripod which is an awesome accessory that’s included with this kit. My phone is not compatible with the focusing feature so the wheel on the side only allows me to zoom, not smoothly I might add, but not a dealbreaker.\n\nEXTENDING FEATURE\nThis gimbal also extends so you can get high up drone-like shots or very low shots. It’s like a selfie stick, but better because it’s also a gimbal! The only downside to this is that because of the extendable feature, you have to be careful when taking it to amusement parks as they often don’t allow extendable devices like this one.\n\n4 GIMBAL MODES\nOut of the 4 modes, the one that’s more “general” or easiest to work with is the first one: Follow mode. It’s going to either pan up or down, left or right, depending on which way you move the camera, and it won’t “roll” sideways. \n\nThe second mode: Tilt Lock, will do just that, lock the tilt and allow you to pan left or right with natural hand movement. If you want to change the angle of the tilt in Tilt Lock mode, just use the joystick to bring the camera’s view up or down. \n\nThe third mode: FPV will actually follow any movement on all 3 axes, so you get more dynamic or creative shots with this mode as it will “roll” (turn the camera sideways) as you’re following a subject. \n\nThe fourth mode: SpinShot allows you to naturally “roll” the camera sideways while still facing a subject, as well as lets the joystick rotate the camera as well, whereas in the other modes, the joystick is moving the camera angle up, down, left or right. SpinShot allows the camera to tilt sideways. To get a visual of what this looks like, look straight ahead then lean your head to one side like you’re putting your ear to your shoulder, and keep looking straight. This is the “roll” effect I’m talking about.\n\nOVERALL\nI love playing with this gimbal. I take it to local music shows and plan to take it to a festival to get some smooth footage and fun pictures. It’s great for people who like to film videos whether it’s for an event or an artistic video piece. This gimbal has plenty of modes to work with to get super creative shots or just get nicely stable footage. I’ve only had to charge it once so far and I’ve used it a few times. There’s a nice indicator screen that shows you modes, battery level, and will let you know with a red light above the battery indicator if the magnet is not secured properly. I can definitely recommend this gimbal to anyone who likes video tech or looking to gift it.",

The quality out of the box is very apparent, the material feels good, the buttons are responsive, the foldable hinges seem durable and the magnetic hold is secure. Installation is very simple, charge the gimbal, unfold it and attach your phone.  The DJI MIMO app connects via bluetooth and takes advantage of your camera with the auto track and the editing options. \nThe gimbal itself is real smooth, your videos take on a floating feel, no more bouncing. The controls are very easy regardless of the modes, TILT, LOCK FOLLOW...the trigger allows quick re-centering, the buttons are well placed to control the movement of the gimbal, the focus and even the zoom buttons are well placed. If you have large hands, the grip may seem a little compact while trying to fit your hands but you can always use the tripod stand and increase the handle area. The extending stick is a little stiff to pull out but it does come in handy for self recording. \n\nOverall a very fun accessory for the best camera you already own , your PHONE.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The DJI Osmo 6 Phone Stabilizer Gimbal is a handheld device that using a gyro-type system, will let you place your smartphone on it, and it stabilizes the phone for photos and videos while you are handholding the device.  As you move, it moves with you, but your phone seems to “float” in it’s holder, not moving at all unless you get carried away and move too much or too fast.  But with normal panning, walking, even jogging, your photos and videos will remain pretty much motion/jerky free.\n\nThe Osmo 6 has a main body that consists of a hand grip and varied controls, along with an arm that extends (which turns it on when you do so).  A strong magnetic disk with stretching clips wraps around your phone and then sticks onto this arm, so you can use it while moving around.  The arm itself also has a telescoping feature so you can extend it and get more than 8 inches of reach as well (think of it as a souped-up selfie stick if you want).  A separate tripod attachment screws onto the bottom and has three legs you can extend – this way, you can use the Gimbal as a tripod for video, photo, podcasts, etc.  It’s a standard mount so you can also use many normal sized tripods as well.\n\nYou need to download the DJI app for best results.  Once installed and set up, your phone connects to the Osmo 6 via Bluetooth, and when you magnetically snap it onto the Gimbal, the app auto-launches on your phone.  There’s a variety of tutorials teaching you how to use the device, and it connects to your phone's album(s) with permission, so you can use it through the app.  It WILL work without the app, but I found some of the features to work in a clunky way without it.\n\nThe controls on the hand grip allow you to pan the camera, back and forth, up and down, control zoom and focus, flip from the main back camera to the front camera, re-center the phone, and track subjects of your choosing, and more.  Some buttons have more than one function based on how many times you click them.  I will say, the sheer number of click combinations for different functions at first seems a bit overwhelming and you will find yourself referring to the manual many times to remember what does what.  It’s not the best experience in my opinion, but in time, all of the combinations should begin to sink in.  \n\nThe Osmo 6 does work as advertised.  Panning at a fairly good clip, it keeps my video steadier than I can do by hand, even if I use the phone’s built-in stabilizer.  Likewise, if taking still photos and you are moving a bit, it will help keep things steady hence, sharper photos and videos. I have a medical condition that sometimes makes it hard to remain super steady, and this definitely made a huge difference. I’ve only seen one or two millisecond hiccups where it stalled, but it hasn’t been common.  The motor is not loud.  Battery life is very good, and it charges via a USB-C port on the side of the main body.  A battery icon on the main body tells you when you’re low.  \n\nThis isn’t the type of device that every person with a phone will want to invest in or spend the money for, especially if you really just use your phone for casual photography with an occasional video.  But if you are more serious about your pics and vids and take a good number of both, and/or you like to experiment with podcasting or making more semi-pro videos, then it’s a worthy investment to make your media look more professionally done.  Not perfect, but recommended if you need it.",

I was asked to collaborate with a cabinetry company and shoot video clips for a kitchen remodel project I designed and built. It was a breeze! The DJI-Osmo Mobile 6 combined with the included Bluetooth connection and video software worked seamlessly. The tutorials had me up and running quickly and were able to refer back to when I had a question. The depth of control was very good and allowed me to dive deeper into filming. One segment had me filming myself and the \"follow\" feature allowed me to move and demonstrate my kitchen design features while it kept me in the frame. The gimbal created smooth motion as I zoomed in or panned across shots. Perfect for B-Roll clips you can use for a video. It also was great at taking stills with the built-in tripod feature. All camera controls are by buttons and triggers on the handle (Bluetooth connected to your phone) of the DJI Osmo 6 , start, stop, zoom, etc from the handle as you shoot the video.....Warning ! this gimbal may cause you to daydream about what you would say in your acceptance speech at the Oscars !",

I can't keep the phone on there because it's a phone and I use it other than a camera.\n\nThe Mobile 6 solves this. It can \"auto\" balance my phone. I'm using the iPhone 14 Pro Max with a case. I even have a bluetooth receiver for a microphone and can handle the size and weight. The app works well with iOS. The follow/tracking mode has improved and works well. It folds up nicely and compact. You can use the tripod extension that comes with it or use a different tripod.\n\nWarning to Android users, there is no official listing of the app from the play store. You will need to enable third party support and download the apk from DJI.",

Its very sensive to how its folded and honestly confusing on folding and unfolding it. I am sure I will get used to that but I think thats how it broke the first time.  I had another gismo brand prior and did not like it. It could not hold my iphone eventho the ad stated it would. My phone was too heavy. The Osmo is easy to use and able to hold and balance my iphone. I love the magnetic clamp too making it easier to place my phone on it. This DJI app is also great. My videos and photos turn out so clear.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The DJI Osmo Mobile 6 is DJI’s latest phone gimbal promising an all in one experience. This gimbal combines a gimbal and selfie stick into one along with DJI’s Mimo app for “efficient shooting, editing, and sharing” which may or may not be your actual experience. After a few days I have to say this gimbal isn’t for everyone. \n\nIn the Box:\n\n-\tOsmo Mobile 6 Gimbal\n-\tMagnetic Phone Clamp\n-\tGimbal Tripod\n-\tPower Cable\n-\tStorage Bag\n\nSetup:\n\nFor best results, you need to download the DJI app which is where you might start to notice a different perspective in the overall user experience whether you are an IPhone or Android user. For Android, you must download the app via APK (because the Google Play Store does not have an official app to download). The APK warns you that the file may contain viruses and harm your device. Chances are it will not but it’s not something you feel overly enthused about.\n\nAfter the app is installed, the phone connects to the gimbal via Bluetooth. The phone itself sits inside a magnetic clamp and then snaps on and off of the gimbal. The process is very simple to get the phone on and off of the gimbal however the clamp may sit in a problem spot depending on your phone design. This varies greatly but if you have buttons in the center or just off center of the edges on your phone, this may be a problem.\n\nThe bottom of the gimbal features a threaded mount to install the tripod mount. Simply screw it on and off and it acts as a tripod. If you want to use the selfie stick function of the gimbal just pull the end up/out and you can use the gimbal in an extended mode.\n\nThe buttons on the hand grip gimbal portion allow you to control most functions of the gimbal/phone app without using the touch screen of the phone itself. You can change modes of the type of shot you want, pan, tilt, control zoom and focus, flip camera views, re-center your phone, and activate/disable active track, etc. If you double click some buttons it will act as different functions. If you are familiar with other DJI products, this will seem very intuitive.\n\nUsage:\n\nThe gimbal does exactly what it claims. It will keep the phone nearly perfectly steady with little effort on your end. This will be substantially better than any optical/digital stabilization in your phones camera from the factory. Sometimes if may often work better with the gimbal if you disable any stabilization on your phone while using the gimbal but this is optional and your experience may differ depending on the phone. \n\nMy only issue that I ran into was the pivot point for the selfie stick always was at the wrong angle when you put it back down into its regular position. So the bottom motor would rub on the edge of the plastic body. It does feel quite delicate when you are pull and pushing on the stick to raise and lower it but I suppose that’s what it was designed to do. \n\nOverall:\n\nThe DJI Osmo Mobile 6 is a great gimbal for your phone to achieve cinematic like footage with excellent stabilization. My biggest complaints are more to do with the Mimo app rather than the gimbal itself. For years, DJI have not released official apps on the Play Store for some reason. I wish they would release an official build so people don’t have to feel like they are letting access to their phone via an APK. In addition, the features should be better optimized for the Android platform like they are for IPhone users. Outside of this, I believe it is a very useful tool for those looking for an affordable all-in-one type of device to create better content.",

It’s works fine when holding it upright but other certain basic movement  it will throw the motor out of wack. The price for this product should be below $100. I bought it for the DJI brand.",

The new jog wheel on the left lets you really zoom in and out very smooth but also give you the opportunity to control your focus. I like that the little screen on this model which tells you which shooting on.",

It also features a USB-C port for charging your phone while you're using the gimbal.\n\nOverall, the DJI Osmo Mobile 6 is an excellent smartphone gimbal that offers a great balance of features, ease of use, and portability. If you're looking for a way to improve the quality of your smartphone video footage, the Osmo Mobile 6 is definitely worth considering.",

        "comment": "The bad:\n1. The app isn't on the play store I would assume because it doesn't meet Google's guidelines.  You need to change phone settings to allow this install.\n2. It only supports the 1x and 3x cameras on the Galaxy S22 Ultra.  Why have a zoom wheel if it can't even access the 10x optical camera?  Also, the 0.6X camera is a no go.\n3. Active track has trouble starting using the hand signal when the background is busy.\n4. Camera and Video functionality is very limited in the mimo app.  No HDR, only 30fps support, no geotagging photos, no pro camera etc..   If you switch to the default phone camera app you cant even use the start/stop button on the gimbal, there is 0 connectivity there. \n5. The ability to look down is very limited. Placing this on a table using its mini stand you cannot look down very far.\n6. Active track only works on the 1x lens.  As soon as you hit 3x it stops zooming while active track is on.  \n\nThe Good:\n1. It is light, quick to setup and not much of a learning curve.\n2. It fits the large S22 Ultra in a thin case and motors can handle it. \n3. Active track when working is great.  \n4. Gimbal serves the purpose of making video smooth.\n5. Price isn't bad compared to other DJI gimbals.\n\nI could get over almost all the negatives if they could get all the cameras supported on this popular phone and if active track could work across each camera.  \n\nPhoto is GoPro in the Volta Handle next to the Insta360 X3, next to this OM6 Gimbal, next to the Ronin SC Gimbal with a APS-C camera.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Overall - Crazy fast feature rich gimble Loaded with Features !\n\n\nThis is great fun and turns your cell phone into device that shoots incredibly good video in almost any situation. A mature and feature rich software support means you can connect a phone, pop it on and just go at it in a few minutes. If you have never used a gimble before - I would recommend the built in tutorial along with YouTube tips and tricks.\n\nAs someone who owns two other older gimbles - This instantly outmoded them. The functionality offered and the reaction speed with which this works is roughly one internet year ahead of anything else I have used. It's awesome.   \n\nSoftware - It just works. Install the app, pair the device and allow it permissions. The controls just work as they should on both my older android and current iPhone. First time setup was under 2 with both phones I tried. \n\nReal World Size and Weight - Folds to very compact. Weight = 1.01Lbs which I consider negligible if you are carrying other gear. I budget packing space in common things I \"know\" - I.e. this device takes the  space of one 16oz bottle of water in my day hike-bike-trip bag.\n\n\"Torture Testing\" - I tried every listed feature on the website - they all worked !  \nI did this as a way to familiarize myself with the controls after completing the built in tutorial as\n well as a tips and tricks on YouTube tutorial. For laughs I threaded it into a mount I have on my mountain bike bars. Trail riding is notoriously hard to shoot whereas you want some amount of jolts and bumps to make it feel more real to the viewer -  It kept up ! I then realized I could use that to grab some subject tracking shots of a buddy I was riding with. Much to my surprise I ended up some really cool footage via that technique whereas I was only trying to test out the stabilization in what I considered an impossible shooting scenario. Next, an idea struck - Subject track a far off object to the side while riding a trail - cool shots of everything whipping by. This gimble is unstoppable and vastly exceeded my expectations ! \n\nPros - \nReaction Speed is top notch !\nCAN be charged/powered while in use.\nMature product software + constant software improvements. \n\nCons - \nSlight learning curve - The tutorial and YouTube are your friends !\nIs it waterproof ? - No.    \n\nOverall - Love it ! I'll be handing down or recycling two other gimbles and I'll likely purchase a second one shortly.",

        "comment": "I'm not sure how this wasn't included in any reviews, but this basically doesn't work with Android. The DJI Mimo App is not in the Play store and if you go to the DJI website to try to download it, you get a sketchy APK that is blocked by like 99% of IT administrators. Reading between the lines, there must be some serious security and/or stability concerns with this app, and it's supposed to be user friendly so APK hacking around security restrictions is not exactly the \"start it up right out of the box\" they advertise. The app is not extraneous either, most of the buttons don't work if you don't have the app, basically you can just pan up, down, and side-to-side. Zoom doesn't work, record doesn't work, none of the other buttons do anything. Total waste of money.",

The lronlem is the biggest reason i pirchased was for perfectly framed level shots. However i have to manually adjust the gimble 2 degrees every time to get it level. Defeats the puppse of using the magnets to quickly attach your phone  for a quick shot. Each time i have to open up the app after phone is connected and adjust 2 degrees :(",

Occasionally my iphone 11 shows the gimbal in the frame (only when on 0.5 view) but it honestly does not bother me because this thing is so cool. I love the stitching feature for panoramic photos. I also love the LightCut app which makes editing videos a breeze. If you’re thinking about getting this, do it. You wont regret it!",

This one, you stick the magnet on the middle of your phone, and then it takes literally 5 seconds to be completely set up and ready to go every time after that. The gimbal is also small, so it fits right in to my Fanny pack! Also like the extension",

        "comment": "I recently purchased the Dji Osmo mobile 6 Mobile Gimbal and I have been blown away by its performance. It has quickly become my go-to accessory when shooting video on my phone.\n\nThe gimbal is incredibly easy to use and provides smooth, stable video footage. It has helped me capture stunning footage on-the-go and has saved me countless hours of video editing in post-production.\n\nOne of the things I love about this gimbal is its compact size. It easily fits in my pocket or camera bag, making it a great tool for traveling. It also has a long battery life so I can shoot for hours without needing to recharge.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend the Mobile Gimbal to anyone who wants to take their mobile videography to the next level. It is a must-have accessory for anyone who wants to capture stunning video footage on their phone.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I've owned an Osmo3 for several years and wanted to upgrade to Osmos6 due to the extended reach this would give me on the stick. Other than this, I couldn't justify spending $160. So I searched online and found an extension rod for just under $20. Osmos6 uses the same software to edit and create as Osmos3, so i decided to return it. Also, Osmos3 came with a hard case while this doesn't.  The build quality on the O3 seemed sturdy and better in my hands (large hands).",

        "comment": "I own two of these gimbals. They are excellent and have quite a few features usually found only on professional gimbals. The second one I bought had problems and refused to properly balance no matter what. Luckily I purchased a protection replacement warranty with it and ended up getting it replaced today. The replacement works perfect, just like the first one. Highly recommended. Be sure to buy the warranty though.",

Do not often use the selfie stick extension, but nice to have it just in case. \nPurchased this a the OSMO 4 could not balance the weight of the 13pro max\nCons: \n- little more heavy\n- you need to learn the button functions, not that straight forward",

        "comment": "I have a tablet that I don't like the finger pad on. I originally went to BB to purchase a usb mouse, and thankfully the BB rep showed me the Bluetooth mouse options. It made sense to try this route so as to keep the 1 usb port on my tablet free. I purchased this Microsoft Bluetooth mouse along with another name brand Bluetooth mouse that had similar reviews to the Microsoft one. They were both on sale for around the same price, but the original price of the other one was higher. I figured I would try both out and return the one I didn't like as much. I tried the Microsoft one first because I thought I would like it better based on the smaller size, 4-way scroll option, only needing 1 battery (compared to the other one needing 2), overall design, and a few other reasons. I was right. Everything worked so well, that I didn't even try out the other mouse. The Microsoft mouse is lightweight but doesn't seem \"cheap\" to me. It responds perfectly and linked up flawlessly with the Bluetooth settings on my tablet. It also comes with a much longer warranty (either 3 or 4 years, but I can't remember) than the other brand, which only had 1 year. Great price. Great product. Hope this helps. Thanks. Matthew 7:12",

As is, it must be turned on and off manually, and it's easy to forget to turn it off.",

        "comment": "Very nicely constructed \"laptop-sized\" mouse with standard buttons, including an extra within the scroll wheel.\r\nPairs very easily with the computer in Bluetooth mode, and the tracking is excellent on all surfaces that I tried, including glass.\r\n\r\nIt uses a single AA battery which is easily accessible by an easily removable tab on the under-surface. Nearby, there is a small on/off button which activates a blue light, which will blink when put into bluetooth discover mode by simply holding down the \"on\" button for a short period. Once paired, the light glows continuously.\r\nUnfortunately, there is no illumination on the upper surface of the mouse to show that it is \"on\", so, it's easy to forget to turn it off; however, in the rest mode, fortunately little current is consumed so that failure to turn it off will impact relatively minimally on battery life.",

The interface is truly Bluetooth in the sense it doesn't require you to plug in a dongle to use the mouth, and thus frees up a USB port, which is a real plus. Pairing the device to your computer is very easy (assuming you use Windows 8.1 and up) and the connectivity is pretty good. Haven't faced any issue so far and really glad I bought it.",

It is smooth and truly enjoyable to use after fighting with a couple of Logitechs that work well with my HP laptop, but very inconsistent and jumpy. The only issue I have had with this (thus the 4 stars) is that is occasionally losses contact with my PC, and the only way to reconnect seems to be restarting the computer. That can be a real pain in the caboose. Otherwise, I love it.",

However on a Macintosh, bluetooth cannot get the link back when waking up from sleep, turning on/off mouse is not enough half the time, have to set up the link from scratch again. I'm going back to Logitech for Macintosh. Still, works great for my Windows based machines.",

I chose this over the Microsoft Sculpt mouse because this design seems more ergonomic when in non-traditional locations like a recliner.\r\n\r\nMy connection has been stable, and I have not encountered any cursor delay.\r\n\r\nThe \"BlueTrack\" technology let this mouse work well on all the surfaces I've used.\r\n\r\nThere are no extra buttons, such as a back button. You may want to look elsewhere if this is important to you.\r\n\r\nBuild quality seems good, and there doesn't appear to be any exterior materials that'll wear out.\r\n\r\nI replaced a Microsoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 4000 with this model. It is roughly the same size, and it is nice to not have a USB transmitter.\r\n\r\nI'd highly recommend this mouse, unless you want extra buttons or a larger size.",

To resolve this you have to be hardwired to your router or us 5.0ghz wifi on your computer",

BlueTrack doesn't seem to do much better than an average mouse but I'm fine with that.",

        "comment": "Laptop has bluetooth, I didn't want to mess with losing a dongle and I needed a mouse for my kids to use.\r\n\r\nI had no problems with pairing and the mouse appears to work fine. It's on the small side which is perfect for my children and wife (she has smaller hands), but I don't feel that it's uncomfortable for me to use (but in fairness I haven't used it extensively for long periods).",

        "comment": "I purchased this Bluetooth mouse for the first time. What seemed like a very simple pairing became a very challenging task. Being not that techy, it took me one hour to pair it to my Dell laptop. Once paired, I started scratching my head again because the mouse is still asleep. I browsed for answers online, paired & unpaired, and browse YouTube. After another long hour, I finally found a sensible suggestion on YouTube.  I almost gave up and was considering throwing this mouse into the valley of the cats.  Now it's awake and working hard. On my 2nd day of use, I panicked because it seemed this mouse is asleep again when I turned on my laptop.  After some guessing game, I was able to determined that you have to turn on the mouse first before turning on your laptop so it gets to connect to each other.  If you don't want this kind of panic every time you use this mouse & turn on your laptop.  Don't buy this",

My biggest complaint is the middle scroll roller/button -- it seems like it's not scrolling at all, then suddenly it will scroll like crazy and pass up the spot I want on the page.  It has a side-scrolling mechanism, but it doesn't work very well because there's no fine control.",

Previous ones that I have owned have always lagged in their response time when I have moved them but this mouse is as fast as any mouse I have owned including a USB and a USB with a cord. The great thing about the Blue Tooth is it does not use one of your USB ports. I highly recommend this product.",

        "comment": "This Bluetooth Mouse makes the perfect pair with newer, light laptops and tablets. Microsoft is also very reliable when it comes to mouses. The only tricky part is synchronizing Windows 10 and the device for the first time. Make sure you have all updates for windows and drivers installed and then try it. After that, you have more precision, good reach and a free USB socket.",

Only criticism is because it is so short you will find the back of your hand resting on the surface rather than on the mouse. The Microsoft Sculpt Bluetooth mouse is longer if that is an issue for you.",

        "comment": "Nice Bluetooth mouse. Small and portable. If comfort is important, you will want to purchase a full-size mouse instead of this mouse.\r\n\r\nThe mouse has a single small recessed button for on, off and Bluetooth-sync. A separate rocker-switch for on-off would have been a better design - obviously. I guess Microsoft thought it was important to save $0.01 by not have a separate switch. Read the instructions to figure out how to use this combo-button. Microsoft has probably already lost money from the confusion and complexity of a combo-button.\r\n\r\nI'm using this mouse with a new, top-of-the-line HP notebook computer with Windows 10 and Bluetooth 4.2 LE (low energy). I have experienced no problems with connectivity.\r\n\r\nI have the cursor sensitivity set to the fastest setting and it still feels like I need to push the mouse a little bit too far to get the cursor to move as much as I would like. Perhaps a new Microsoft mouse driver will help that. I'm currently using the default Windows 10 mouse driver.",

My downfall is it didn’t last long being able to move the cursor where I needed it to be. It keeps getting stuck. I’ve tried changing batteries, that wasn’t the problem. I’ve tried moving the mouse closer to my computer, that didn’t help. I bought a mousepad (even though when I first used it I didn’t need to) and that didn’t help. There’s nothing more irritating than when you need this mouse to work and it doesn’t. For the time now, it will do, but I will be looking for another one.",

It's not for gaming.\n\nI purchased this Bluetooth mouse due to a connectivity issue stemming from my HP Spectre X360's connectivity issues with my old Logitech K317.  (The K317 - and the K360 keyboard - still work perfectly on every other device.)\n\nThis mouse has a constant, solid, dependable Bluetooth connection.  It is roughly the same size as the Logitech K317 which is itself about the right size for a normal-sized hand.  I prefer this mouse to the Logitech because it's less slippery on the sides and the scroll wheel.\n\nI might have to buy a few of these to connect to my other machines.",

It works on many surfaces: my desk, my mouse pad, & my marble kitchen table. My only wish is that it would have some auto shutdown feature built in instead of a manual power down. I keep forgetting to turn it off after use!! I'm so use to a wired mouse (if I use a mouse) my battery is dying quickly!!! I'm use to not using a mouse I haven't had to make any sort of conscious effort to remember anything. But overall I really do like it and recommend it for a good cheep mouse.",

        "comment": "Good mouse so far.  Compact, tracks nicely, has the tilt wheel for horizontal scrolling.  Up and running quickly.  Doesn't have the extra buttons on the side that quite a few mice have, but I don't really ever use those anyway.  Wheel and buttons are a little noisier than some other mice.  Like that it's bluetooth so don't have to mess with a dongle.  Comfortable in hand.  Only uses a single AA - have yet to see if its life is consistent with product claims.  At $20, it's a bit more than the no-name bluetooth mouse I'd purchased several years ago that only recently has been losing its connection - I think I paid about $10 for that one.  Guess the extra $10 is for Bill.",

Using it is pretty comfortable. I have big hands, so using a smaller than usual mouse is not easy. Which brings up to my last point...\r\n\r\nCon: If your looking for a compact, travel mouse, this might not be for you. I still take it everywhere, but it's not compact at all.\r\n\r\nOverall: There's really nothing I can say about it that's bad. So far, I don't have any issues. It's just a users preference when and how to use it. It's a good buy.",

It makes a really nice travel mouse (compact in size and no cords, connectors, or plug-ins to fool with), and it works great, in general, with very good resolution, but it doesn't work on glass, and sometimes it seems a little slow to respond on a non-solid surface (e.g. loose cloth). On a solid surface (like a desktop, tabletop, or tight fabric), absolutely no problems. \r\n\r\nP.S. Just make sure that whatever device you may want to use this mouse with is compatible with Bluetooth 4.0, the level that this mouse uses.",

The on/off button is a little tricky, need to hold for a long time to bypass the pairing stage (especially once it has been paired already). Other than that, the traction and mouse performance is very accurate.",

I have found that the Microsoft version is not as easy to manipulate as the Logitech version, doesn't roll as well, and because the on/off button is a press-down button, it is hard to tell when the mouse is off, as compared to the Logitech on/off switch. The Microsoft version is also heavier and more mounded, so it is not as comfortable in my small hand. I would not buy the Microsoft mouse again.",

The big problem I have with this item is that I have to reset the bluetooth connection frequently (often several times a day), as the mouse continually disconnects randomly from the bluetooth.  The only way I've found to get it going again is to turn off the bluetooth on the computer then turn it back on and let the mouse reconnect.  Needless to say, this really doesn't work for me.  I'll have to buy another kind of mouse.",

I constantly am moving from home to the shop, coffee shops and whatnot, and this mouse fits nicely in my bag with my laptop and charger. I&#39;ve used it on uneven surfaces, and as long as I have my mouse pad, have had no problems.  I like not having a cord or wifi usb bit to worry about while taking my laptop around everywhere, also less pieces to loose along the way.  The click is soft and so is the scroll, which I find is a nice perk, feels like better quality. Has good control and moves smoothly.  I gave this mouse 4/5 because it&#39;s on the small side, which is perfect for small lady hands, but I could see being an issue for men with larger hands who are looking to buy this product.",

        "comment": "This is one of only a few truly Bluetooth mouse I've come across, and I really like it! It fits nicely in my small hand and the sides are of a nice material that lets you comfortably rest your thumb (and pinkie, if you're like me) against them without being slippery. I really like that it has a power switch, too, because I don't leaving things on when I'm not using them, so I can turn the mouse off overnight or if I'm not using my laptop for prolong times.\n\nThe mouse is perfectly symmetrical, so I think it could work just as well with predominant left hand users, so long as you can change the settings on your computer and tell it that the right button of the mouse will be the primary button (unless you don't mind using your middle finger as your primary button-clicking finger).",

        "comment": "Mouse worked fine on a Windows 10 computer, but mouse movements hung several times on a Windows 7 Platform. In previous MS Bluetooth mouse versions, there was additional buttons above the thumb which really was handy for things like paging forward and back (default functions). Seems like no Bluetooth mouse has this anymore. Judging from the increasing amount of tablet-styled computers that require Bluetooth, you'd think the more modern mouse features should be included in the latest Bluetooth mouses.",

        "comment": "after swiping my tablet screen a million times, and needing to clean it very often, I looked for a Blue Tooth Mouse to move me along quicker. It works very well, even using a magazine to set it on instead of a mouse pad. Family laughed when I bought it, after watching the ease of using it flawlessly, they also purchased one for themselves. Just wish the red \"ON\" indicator was on the top and visible so you knew when to switch it off. Other than that, buy one of you can find one, they sell out quickly",

        "comment": "I am never sure this mouse will work with my new Windows 10 laptop. I’ve had to pair it repeatedly even though it is listed as a device that is “working properly”. No mouse movements. No click. Nothing. My first attempt was to delete, then re-add it. I could not add it again until I updated Windows to the latest release - 1709. After that, I successfully re-added it, only to find after shutdown then boot a day or two later, it’s not working again. So instead of deleting it, I paired it again even though I see it plainly in the device list. So now I have 3 identical MS mice connected. I am thinking of returning it and get something else. I wanted the wireless Bluetooth so I can free up a USB port. Oh, and I am on my third battery, thinking that was the problem. It worked today. Will see if it works tomorrow. :(",

        "comment": "Ever since the switch from rolling ball to optical laser-controlled mice, I have purchased them from Microsoft and have never been disappointed. I write this review in part with a decade+ old wired, optical mouse. This bluetooth mobile mouse is no exception. It features easy set-up, nice laser response, a very comfortable grip, with snappy clicking, and a responsive scroll wheel. A perfect mouse to pair to a laptop with a poorly implemented touchpad.",

        "comment": "I bought this mouse to use as a multipurpose tool for my laptop, tablet and raspberry pi. Firstly, it has no support on raspbian which is the OS for the pi. Tablet and laptop use however are ok. at first the mouse was really responsive and a great asset for AutoCAD and Solidworks (modelling programs). However after a few weeks I find the responsiveness to be spotty at times. Likely because it&#39;s Bluetooth but just keep that in mind",

        "comment": "I have had an AliveCor monitor for over 2 years now.  It is very useful for tracking long term trends and I know it is highly accurate in detecting Afib.  In my case however, it has misdiagnosed Afib where it did not occur.  It has done this at least 3-4 times. I sent in for a paid analysis and it was confirmed the ecg was interpreted incorrectly by their programming.  I also had an issue where intermittently the device would not work at all.  This started occurring 10 months into my ownership and unfortunately I waited too long (4 more months) to inquire about the problem and was told it was out of warranty.  I was subsequently able to correct this problem short term by bending the battery connections out to make better contact with the battery, but I still have to frequently spin the battery  inside the case in order for it to work, and occasionally bend the battery contacts back out.  I don't have this problem with any other device I have that uses a coin battery.  I do have time periods where I get frequent PVC's, and the AliveCor is very helpful in putting a number on these.  All in all I'm sure it definitely works as advertised.  I'm hopeful that in the future it may also measure other arrhythmias or things such as QT intervals.",

        "comment": "First if you have a concern about your heart racing or pounding, get off the internet, call 911 and get to your nearest hospital!!\n\nIf you are still here, then maybe you only have a mild concern. In short, Kardia is as good as the positive reviews say!! I bought it in store, installed the App and was able to use it right away. I did not pay for any extra subscriptions so I can’t say anything about those. \n\nI will say that my heart was periodically racing, pounding… (I did not think it was that serious.) It was mainly in the evening when the doctor’s office is closed. I looked at reviews, bought it, tried it and saw “unclassified” and “Possible Atrial Fibrillation!” I called my cardiologist and made an appointment. (I probably should’ve went to the ER, but this was early Covid time). I told the doctor about the readings, at first he said “I don’t trust those things.” After my EKG in the office he said “let me see that again.” My saved Kardia reports matched his! He explained how to read the EKG and the irregularities. I now will be taking two low dose medications for life but now my EKGs are “normal” or as they say now “normal sinus rhythm.” I’m alive 2 years later to write this review. Best life saving purchase that I have ever made!!",

        "comment": "My cardiologist suggested getting this unit - I have bradycardia and LBBB. It's a very simple unit, and I had it glued to the back of my iPhone for several months, taking ECG readings whenever I felt \"off\" or dizzy. The only correlate was when my HR fell below 40. Then I got tired of the iPhone being thicker and unstuck the unit, which I now leave on my desk and use separately. Alas, having the sensor unit separate presents its own problems - when I carry it in my pocket the battery falls out! It's easy to put back in, but I worry about it. The software app has been updated since I first got it, and I can't figure out some things that were easy before, like deleting a noisy reading. The app tries to detect if you have atrial fib, but not other conditions. It thinks my LBBB traces are \"Normal\" unless my HR is below 50, in which case it sort of gives up. My only other question about the system is how it smooths the data - the first few seconds of readings are really noisy with a lot of baseline drift, then suddenly it smooths out. Only sometimes it overlays a much faster pulse which it eventually decides to remove. Overall, very useful. Amazing it's so small.",

        "comment": "On the advice of my primary care physician (PCP), I purchased this device to be able to monitor myself for incidences of atrial fibrillation.  It could not have been easier to set up and to use.  Because my phone is 3 yrs old, before purchasing, I checked the AliveCor website to verify that my Android Samsung is compatible.  I had no difficulty downloading the App.  Getting readings of my heart rate and EKG was simple--it takes only 30 seconds.  After saving the results to my phone, I can email them to my PCP.  My cardiologist viewed the saved results at my next appointment, which was useful to confirm that I had experienced one incident of a-fib. (Note: He does not provide email access to his patients, and my EKG results cannot be uploaded to the patient portal.  He thinks it is good that I got the Kardia, but advised me to only record my EKG if I am feeling that I might be in a-fib.)   When using the Samsung Health App on my phone, I often have difficulty getting a reading of my heart rate, which is measured with a finger sensor. There is no such issue on the Kardia.

        "comment": "My five star rating is for the monitor itself and the concept.  I use it twice a day and it saves me from taking coumadin et. al. on the off chance that my A-fib might return.  For that alone I would give it ten stars.  However, I feel that the software could badly use some improvements:  1. The iPhone app crashes much too often when taking or deleting a reading.  This never happened until Version 3.0.2. 2.  There is no way to easily discard a reading.  You have to save it first (a 2 step process), and then go through the 3 step process to delete it.  This is far too much work.  To make matters worse, the down arrow for Edit/Delete is so small  that I miss it half the time, thus adding even more steps. 3.  The web site could be very useful for observing trends over a longer period of time (I often need to view the trends in my heart rate over several weeks).  Alas, the web site only only shows 3 days/6 readings on a page (which is largely useless)  and each reading takes up far too much room on a page.  I would love to see all readings for the current month, prior month, etc. in a nice concise format.  I hope that 2016 will see some major upgrades.",

        "comment": "I bought a 2nd device so that I could see if the artifact I was seeing on my original device was a result of the device failing or my improper use of it.  So far, there is no conclusion I can reach.\n\nOverall, I give the device a very good rating.  When I first showed the device to my cardiologist in May of 2015 he said it was just a toy and of no value.  Nine months later he'd turned around 180 degrees.  I don't know what happened in the mean time but he now thinks it very useful.  My GP thought it was a great device from the beginning.  All the nurses I've shown it to in cardiac rehab didn't know such a device existed and thought it was great. \nI recently required the services if an electrophysiologist.  He though the recordings I'd made before seeing him showing potential Afib/Aflutter and the recordings made post-ablation were very useful and he gave me his email address to keep him apprised of my progress.\nEven though the device is not a diagnostic tool and it records just one lead,  it is so much better to have recordings that can be seen by others instead of just showing up at the ER saying, \"I think something's wrong\"!",

        "comment": "I only bought this a few days ago and already I'm pleased.  I like how it works, how simple it is to use, how small it is (I've ordered a case for it so it won't be lost), and how I can see the results instantly.  I have an apple watch and this, I think adds additional peace of mind.\r\nHowever, two things.  1) While the app does sync with Apple Health Kit, it doesn't sync with the blood pressure readings, that I must take several times a day.  It has space for me to add the info, but I would rather it added it itself, because it already adds the EKG readings from the apple watch, so I'm confused why it doesn't with the BP.\r\n2) It requires a microphone, which is logical, so I have to turn off the podcasts or audible books I spend the most time listening to.  I'm ok with that.  What does bother me though, is that I also have to turn off my hearing aids(!!!) because they are bluetooth and sync to my phone.  That is actually unpleasant for me.  I know it's only for a minute, at the most, but still, it's something I hope that Kardia can eventually work around.  \r\nOther than those two issues, I like Kardia and will keep using it.",

        "comment": "The good:  Small fits in a wallet, or attaches to the back of your phone.  The bad: It attaches to your phone back so coins in your pocket can run down the battery. For more than the basic reading you have to pay a subscription.  They pray on fear and try to get you to pay for consultations and advanced features.  Privacy statement says they can sell your data to other parties.  Needs to be less than 10 inches from your phone to get a good signal and connection.  Recently purchased it hoping for a better resolution and ease of use for readings.  I got an pulse rate warning from my watch, used the watch EKG and it showed Afib detected, I tried the Kardia, nope, you're fine.  Checked my watch EKG again, it still showed Afib.  Tried an older Omron monitor I have, it showed Afib.  Tried the Kardia again, nope, normal sine.  I have had this happen on two different occasions several days apart. The closest it came to any abnormal reading was unclassified.   If I have symptoms and it shows on 2 other devices, but not this one, then it's a piece of crap that I don't want.  Taking it back.  I would not recommend it to anyone.",

        "comment": "I have been having feeling of exhaustion for many years.  Doctors couldn't find anything.  I recently purchased the KardiaMobile and had serious exhaustion issues on 1/31/22 and 2/1/22.  Told my doctor and triage nurse.  They had me come in for an EKG and to see the doctor on 2/4/22.  Everything was normal, especially since I wasn't having and issue.   My doctor ordered an Echocardiogram to ben done at the hospital on the 16th and set up to wear an extended heart monitor on the 21st.  Well on 2/10 I had another serious issue, 157 BPM according to KardiaMbile.  It faded away, it seemed.  Then on 2/11 it came on strong again so I went to the hospital emergency.  I was considered a patient who needed urgent care because their EKG showed I was in Atrial Fibrillation with BPM of 160.  My daughter originally thought on 2/10 that I was having a panic attack.  My Fir Bit Watch and my Pulse Oximeter did not show anything.  My heart rate on them was normal.  Thank you KardiaMoible.  You may have saved my life.  And I originally purchase KardiaMobile for curiosity and fun.",

        "comment": "Great product! My only concerns are a very faint Electrical noise when touching it now while doing things on my phone. I'm wondering if it's because I've dropped my phone a couple of times with it on the back. I've taken it off sense as to not damage it any further, however then I don't use it as often. I've used it on my dog by spraying his fur with alcohol, and it works! Also, I have seen numerous doctors here in Texas about it, including the cardiologist, and nobody knew it existed and they thought it was the coolest thing. They would recommend it if they knew easily how to get it at cetera. So really my only complaint after having it over a year is for someone to tell me what that electrical noise is, if it is harmful to me or the equipment, or my phone, and maybe it needs to be slightly more durable... But then again maybe it's fine. I would like instructions or way of how to do it while exercising with that maybe asking too much! Keep up the good work! Get an advertising program too! It's a good product and worth it!",

        "comment": "I love the AliveCor Mobile ECG device. My wife has heart trouble, so I can easily assess her ECG status and notify her physician if there is a problem. I also teach exercise physiology at Chico State, so I use it often in class. I also use it during my own exercise program.  I have several suggestions:  1. Integrate the unit into a protective case for the iPhone. My phone face cracked when I substituted the AliveCor system for an Otterbox (broke when I dropped the phone on the ground). 2. Modify the unit so it works during exercise. You could wire the phone to a bipolar lead system a person could wear during physical activity. I currently use it to check my heart rate and EKG during intense bike rides. I stop and take my EKG standing up. When I am extremely fatigued, It is sometimes difficult to get a good measurement. 3. The new interface is inconvenient. I liked the history button on the old interface. Also, the patient's name should be clearly visible on each strip.  Otherwise, I think this is a first-class device.",

I called my doctor and immediately went in for an ekg.  I really was in afib.  Definitely would recommend.",

Her cardiologist thinks she is going into a  paroxysmal afib but so far we haven't been able to get a recording of it.   She even spent a week on a portable monitor but unfortunately did not experience any episodes.  After seeing this product advertised I felt it might be worth checking out....It appeared easy to use so I ordered it.  It is about the size of a credit card and once the app was downloaded it worked easily and as advertised.  The first EKG  was taken and within 12 hours the result was received releasing the Kardia for use.  I then tried the Kardia on myself and received an instant readout of Lead I and was able to print a hard copy for my records.  I feel it will be invaluable due to its small size and ease of use in diagnosing the palpitations my wife is experiencing as it can literally go anywhere she goes.   Great product.  Thank you.",

Clinic EKG showed Sinus Rhythm (unlike the Kardia EKG  a few hours earlier) as did all earlier Kardia EKGs this week upon review from Cardiac CNP.",

Sometimes it would do that at heart rate 105 and above.",

I have used it at least 300 time in the last 15 months. It has provided me invaluable feedback, teaching me what my symptoms translate to. I now know that what I thought was just an exhausted jittery feeling requiring 5 more cups of coffee to cure is high speed fibrillation/flutter requiring medical attention. I wish I had this years ago when these symptoms started.....I was undiagnosed for likely ten years. My cardiologists have both relied on AliveCor readings I have e-mailed them or shown them in office visits. One cardiac technician told me the AliveCor produces better results than the ECG device in their office. It has helped me recover, understand what literally ticks me off, and how to control my symptoms (I am 7 months post-ablation and doing well, finally). And it is the best cocktail party conversation starter ever....",

My only issue is: I think you should be able to print your heart health report without having to purchace any additional services.\r\nTrying to download , print to file, etc. is not to user friendly.\r\nOther than that , this appears to be a great device.",

It has helped to confirm a condition I have been recently diagnosed with (POTS). However, you can't read anything accurately between QRS complexes, and a paid reading will only tell you if your BPM is brady, tachy, or normal/normal unknown origin -- something that anyone with 30 seconds research will already know. Plus, I've gotten a-fib and flutter readings that weren't actually a-fib or flutter. The other downside is you can't get lead 2 when you're standing up and I've never had much luck with the chest readings even though I am thin. That being said, I am SUPER glad to have this bc it is helpful and extremely convenient. Also, the human readings have never taken more than a couple of hours to come back, and most come back in minutes. I think it has a great future, especially in mobile medicine and patient health management.",

She can now record any subsequent events and send them to a cardiologist coincident with a consultation. Technology will further empower patients to participate in their care.  jag",

There are other ways to carry around with you too. It is fairly thin, light and relatively inexpensive. App allows you to send the 30 second EKG off to your doctor for viewing.",

Upon urging from a nurse I went to the ER where they diagnosed me with full blown AFib at 289 bpm. They got me under control with meds and now I’m at 68 bpm. Dr said I just avoided a stroke or heart attack.",

I initially secured it to the phone with the provided adhesive but that make my protective shell for the phone unusable so I pried it loose. When simply held against the back of the phone (with the silicone bumber still in place) the \"velvet\" left on the electrodes acts to keep it from slipping about, and after a couple complexes of trash I get a fine tracing.   The electrode unit has had a few troubles with the battery contact, I have had to open it up or tap it strongly a few times but it starts working again.   The sharing options have been very useful.  I actually sent a copy of a reacing labelled \"afib\" to my electrophysiologist via email attachment. He called me in and I was carfdioverted and my medications adjusted. The device was a great source of curiosity to the hospital staff (I brought it in and used it daily).  Go ahead and stretch this to make and sell a cordless 12 lead machine!",

Even \"registered doctor\" does not describe what he is reading and usually recommends to go ask your own physician. To read the records of AliveCor you have to have some knowledge at least of basic EKG reading",

The Samsung Galaxy 8 has been around for a long time now and yet you're still not compatible with it? How can you sell a product that's so far behind? Are customers supposed to go out and buy an old phone from some old phone website? I don't even know if I could buy an old phone just for this purpose, although I suppose I would if the old phone were cheap enough. PLEASE make it a priority to be compatible with the technologies that people are actually using, now. Not what people were using 2 years ago. That just doesn't work. You have to keep up. I'm so frustrated because I really, really do need this device. What should I do? Maybe you ought to sell the older phones at a reduced price so people can buy your device?

My computer (and Windows phone, for that matter) are both Bluetooth compatible and could use the same app. It seems like adding a Windows-based app for use with PCs would make your device accessible to a much larger crowd.",

Still worth the money if you are interested in only keeping a record of your EKG,",

        "comment": "It can be really hard to use.  You're supposed to just put your fingers on the pads, but 90% of the time, it just doesn't register.  Or it starts working and then I'll have only two seconds to go, and then it stops and tells me that it was interrupted and I have to do it again - and that will happen ten times in a row (even though I didn't do anything to interrupt it).  Or it just doesn't work at all - the pads don't register my fingers as existing at all.  It's incredibly frustrating.  The other thing I'm confused about it what it's really supposed to do.  I mean, so far, it just tells me that I have \"normal sinus rhythm\", but what else?  Can't you give me any more information than that?  I requested a cardiologist's review, but never got anything back about it.  I feel like I spent an awful lot of money on something that only works some of the time and so far only tells me that I'm \"normal\" about one thing.  I thought it would do more.",

So, I bought the device just to have and my husband was able to detect that he was in a.fib His rhythm was confirmed by a 12-Lead EKG. I was impressed with the accuracy of the device! I would recommend this to anyone.",

        "comment": "Kardia Mobile is an amazing tool that sticks to the back of your Iphone. You download an app called Kardia. I have heart issues where my heart starts racing frequently. I simply click on the App and it will record an EKG of my heart. It will give you a diagnosis. You can email them to your MD directly from app. Two years ago I had several episodes of Atrial Fibrillation.  I emailed them to my cardiologist who immediately started me on a blood thinner. AFIB is very dangerous and causes strokes. This device has saved my life. Most people who have strokes do not know they have AFIB. Having the EKG evidence not only got me on the blood thinners, but I am being treated at the Cleveland Clinic for a surgery to eliminate the AFIB. It is amazing that I caught the AFIB. None of my holter monitors had found it. Now I am on a path at one of the finest heart hospitals in the world. Thank you for inventing this. I have recommended it to so many friends.",

        "comment": "I purchased the KardiaMobile two weeks ago.  I have persistent AFib most of the time, with occasional periods when I am out of AFib, although I am unable to detect when in AFib. The technology of this device is incredible.  AliveCor could not say if it was compatible with my LG model G7 ThinQ phone because they had not tested the device with that specific phone.  Regardless, I purchased the device and it is compatible with my phone as well as with my wife's IPhone.  The device is easy to set up, and fast and easy to operate.  The results compare favorably with results from EKG in cardiologist office.  Most of my readings  are indicated to be Possible AFib, with occasional Unclassified readings.  Readings for my wife, who does not have any known heart issues, are indicated to be Normal.  I email the charts to my cardiologist on a weekly basis.  I have a friend who has AFib, and has used this device for a long time.",

When I awoke the next morning, my results had been returned and I was ready to record as needed. \n\nI had a follow up appt with my heart PA on 7-26-16 and she was impressed with its ease of use and its accuracy.  (Unfortunately, I have yet to get their code so I can send an EKG to my heart doctor.) On 7-28-16 evening, it caught an A Fib episode (209 bpm) with a day's worth of 'unclassified' recordings before this episode.  \n\nI am trying hard not to become obsessed with my heart issues and go about my day as usual.  But, knowing we can catch an episode and perhaps pinpoint a specific area for the upcoming 'mapping' ablation is very comforting.  I have had no problems with recording or the device saving the recordings.  It has worked as advertised and then some.  Congrats on a great product!",

Thus I invested in AliveCor and I sleep well knowing that I do not have A-Fib.",

I see my doctor regularly but between visits I attempt to understand and optimize my workouts, rest & diet in order to minimize my A-Fib episodes.  I have made significant progress while learning.  I would like to see AliveCor's use and information expanded through the development or integration of other devices/applications.  Currently, I use Polar Beat with a Polar H7 bluetooth HR monitor for my workouts.  I wear a Fitbit HR to measure my sleep and daily activity.  I use Lose It! to track my diet/nutrition and finally when I am out of rhythm, I use Pill Monitor to track my medication.  Fitbit, Lose It! and Polar Beat integrate some of each others information which I find useful.  As an example, it would be great if AliveCor could read & utilize Polar's H7 bluetooth heart rate monitor strap during workouts. Keep up the good work!",

My husband got me a Kardia and suddenly I was able to record an episode myself. I was able to record my pulse increase to 220 bpm and see the irregularities as my rhythm changed from tachycardia to possible atrial fibrillation. After a trip to the emergency room my doctor decided that I did have atrial fibrillation and ordered a stress test. She has been able to adjust medication because I have documentation. I went to the office for a 12 lead ekg Friday morning which was fine, then had a 5 hour episode that evening with possible atrial fibrillation and tachycardia. I was able to see that the pulse stayed at 120-122 bpm most of the time with an occasional rise to 136 and bpm. The peace of mind this small device gives me is worth every dime. I am seriously considering upgrading to the 6 lead Kardia.",

        "comment": "I think the AliveCor worked well. I only wish it could be more responsive at times needed. For example if you have a heart flutter or palpitation your phone might not be immediately accessible. When this occurs you do not capture the rhythm you needed or wanted. I think it should be available on a watch or have a chest band to get the information immediately.",

If I feel something strange, I can send my ECG to my cardiologist by email AND I have a record of recent ECG's to show any emergency room doctors.  I live over 100 miles from my cardiologist,  but I know that he can direct my care should I have an emergency.",

        "comment": "When I was diagnosed with A-Fib in November for 2015,  I did a lot of research, determined to \"cure\" my A-Fib, without surgery.  I bought my Kardia and methodically tracked my readings.  As I wasn't in persistent A-Fib or having severe symptoms, it wasn't always easy for me to know if I was in or out of NSR.  This made it very difficult for me to determine the things (work stress, diet, physical activity, etc..) that were triggering my A-Fib.  Kardia took the guess work out of it.  Ultimately, I primarily use my Kardia to verify that I am in \"possible A-Fib,\" when I don't feel \"right.\"  Kardia has been a great tool for me to learn/verify my symptoms, and to share real world data with my EP.  \n\nNew use for my Kardia:  A few days ago I had a catheter ablation, all went well.  Today I used my Kardia for my first post-ablation reading...so happy to see the word \"Normal.\"  I look forward to tracking many more \"Normal\" readings.. :)",

After two days of \"absent signal\", the original battery was found to be defective.  A new battery produced sporadic images and signal.  Final image was achieved (three-bar registration) ONLY when the device was placed directly on the laptop screen.  An unreliable and discouraging device.",

As I no longer take heart medication my EP suggested I use Alivecor  occasionally to check that I am still AF free. As I had few symptoms it was always a worry that I might be in AF without knowing. I check once a week it is quick, easy and puts my mind at rest.  I would recommend Alivecor to anyone with AF.",

Ok - that's just how it went for me. I didn't want to find out I had heart disease, and had to grow up. But, I'm in health care, so it was easier to read about my disease.\nThis device is i bit small/unstably on your stomach, and you must have moist fingers or the device never finds \"baseline\". The mfg must be nuts not giving you some way to steady your fingers, phone and device, and moist fingers.  I'm in the trade, so patient. Woe be new users. But, a thick book, salt water presoaked fingers, and the will to learn some basics. Finally, sending this to an on line cardio seems nuts except AFIB or multiple PVCs, which you need to get to an ER. This requires learning IMHO. And DON'T  take \"your\" EKG.  IMHO. You'll look like an idiot.",

The only issues were that the device often needed to be extremely near (right next to) the smartphone and that a reading which said possible fibrillation appeared to be a completely normal reading according to a cardiologist. Otherwise, the reassurance of being able to take unlimited EKGs made the device very worthwhile for me.",

        "comment": "I think that found a fix for the Android compatibility issues. Apparently, KardiaMobile uses ultrasonic waves to communicate with the smartphone through the smartphone's microphone. So, I downloaded the SoniControl app from the Android play store and ran the AliveCor app, WHILE the SoniControl firewall was running at the same time. What that firewall does is, it apparently stops Android from blocking those signals. New versions of Android seem to block ultrasonic signals by default. Perfect little device otherwise. \r\n\r\nJust be aware of privacy and security issues with using SoniControl. I recommend that you switch the firewall off, when you are not running the AliveCor app.\r\n\r\nMy husband has frequent PVCs / bigemeny and it gives us a piece of mind!!!\r\n\r\nVery easy to use, once the phone compatibility issue got resolved. We use the minute-long readings. 30 seconds is too short for the cardiologist's review.",

        "comment": "I find the AliveCor Mobile ECG very easy and interesting to use.  I have AFib, PVCs and flutter.  Using the ECG I found I also have PACs.  Since purchasing the monitor last June, 2015, I have not had an AFib episode.  I still plan to monitor my heart daily and maybe someday log an AFib episode to see what my heart is actually doing.    I haven't experimented with any ECG position other than my fingers on the electrodes.  Maybe someday I will try the other connection methods.  The only problem I've had with the monitor is extraneous signal interference.  For example, I just returned from a three week cruise and couldn't use the ECG monitor because of the ships interference.  It might not be possible to provide a more stable connection from the ECG to the phone app.  If you can, that would be appreciated.  I don't do any symptom logging because I never have any symptoms aside from the irregular rhythm of my heart.",

        "comment": "My son has dysautonomia with a fast heart rate. Kardia Mobile makes it easy to get a quick EKG when he is feeling dizzy. It made it very easy to give his doctor the results. Just wish it could record blood pressure too.  Just make sure to have your phone very close to the monitor. When I first got it, I had it too far away from my phone and was not getting a good reading.",

It does fit the phone without the sensor in place.\n\nIt looks like an engineer just cut two square holes in a standard jacket and never tried it out.\n\nJohn",

The rhythm strip shown is not tachycardia. Surely if you are selling a medical device that interprets heart rate and rhythm, your ad team should be comprised of people who know basic cardiac rhythms. I would not trust this device for that reason.",

The Kardia Mobile has saved me and my wife a lot of worry, and the expense of unnecessary trips to the ER to confirm my suspicions that my heart flutter was only minor. Very affordable peace of mind for those with episodes of heart flutter, or past episodes of A-Fib that were successfully restored to normal heart rhythm. The Carry Pod is an inexpensive accessory that looks like part of your key chain and makes it even easier to have the Kardia Mobile with you at all times. The Kardia Mobile device will report A-Fib if I have it so I can get immediate medical care.  It also provides me with an EKG that can be emailed to my doctor for reference.  My doctor reminded me to get immediate medical care for severe or persistent flutters, but confirmed that the EKG's I sent to her via email did not show any serious palpitations.",

I liked that the time it measured could be adjusted, events could be starred, and that it was always with me being integrated into a phone case. It's a great design.",

One Saturday night ( so a weekend) I flipped into the weird arrhythmia and quickly got an EKG and it was A-Fib at rapid capture rate of 132 to 150. It lasted 5 hours. I called snd sent both normal and abnormal EKGs to my cardiologist on Monday morning and he put me on a blood thinner to prevent stroke until I could see him in 3 weeks ( which was totally fine and good care). I have had a couple followup procedures to check out my heart further and possible causes. Thank you Alivecore. Unit more than triple paid for itself in one use.",

I've had a couple of cardiac ablations and this gizmo helps me to track my progress as I heal from the latest ablation.  When I see my cardiologist Or the NP I can show  them the ekg with the date, time and symptoms.  Invaluable for communicating what's been happening.",

No monthly charge.  No more wondering if your heart is in sinus rhythm or not. You can take all your readings to your doctor in one app.  You can also store your EKG readings in the AliveCor app on your phone for no charge also.",

He reviews the stored records in detail as part of each of our appointments with him and thus knows exactly what has been going on.",

My Husband’s heart rhythm goes into Afib and he had half his ablation done and waiting for the other side of his heart to be done. We can check his heart rate on my phone app but this little device works with the phone and besides giving heart rate and blood pressure it tells whether your heart is in rhythm. Fantastic and easy to use!!",

Having to take my phone case off and then put it back on to use the ECG was getting annoying and so this is why I stopped.

Didn't want to use the sticky tape that came with it b/c I was worried about its strength and getting it off if I needed too. After maybe a year I looked down and my unit was gone. I got another one. I did not want to order the one with the iphone case because I like the case I have. I was thinking about other ideas to suggest: maybe a container that hold the device and clips on to my keyring? or could be hung on my purse or belt?  I'm afrasd to stick it on my phone now. I probably bumped my phone and it fell off. Not sure what happened. I have a clip on my phone which I attaches to my clothes and so I cannot put it on my phone directly. It barely fits as it is but the device fits accross the end of the phone. Just a thought. Thanks.",

My heartbeat occasionally drops below 50, which is normal for me, however, AliveCor reports that as unclassified.",

Battery cover broke the first time I tried to open it to replace the battery... not a good sign of quality.  For not much more money I got something else that has USB power, connects to my phone through bluetooth, and doesn't require a subscription service to save unlimited test results.  I do not recommend the product at all.",

        "comment": "This single lead ECG is a more convenient recording, but doesn't offer as much diagnostic potential as it only looks at the heart from 1 angle. For those seeking a more detailed ECG get the KardiaMobile 6L instead.\n\nOtherwise, it's a great little device, works every time and helps to assess your situation better.\n\nIt's accurate, and the battery lasts at least a year. I reccomend to anyone concerned with their heart health.",

There have been times in the recent past when I have been completely still and silent and I get the reading that is is unable to read because I need to go to a more quite place. One time it was 11:00 at night when I was lying in bed! I hope it is accurate so that I have good protection from AFib.",

Yesterday it stopped working completely.  I understand there are lemons with anything, but I've taken about 10 readings and now my device is dead.

I get more \"Unclassified\" readings than I do normal or AF readings.  Sometimes I have to take 10+ readings before I get one that is recording anything other than \"Unclassified\".  I can't seem to find out how to get a better eading or even if that is possible.  Seems like I may have wasted my money :(",

I was able to tell the 911 operator immediately what is going on for a fast response before it progressed. Gets rid of the guessing, I know what is happening and the action to take.

        "comment": "First off I want to say that I am a physician.  I am an internist and have been reading EKG's everyday on the job since 1988.  No doubt tens of thousands by now, and was excited about the device when I found out about it when I myself thought I had A fib.  I have had 2 different Alive Cor monitors.  The first one I bought produced a high quality tracing.  Unfortunately it quit working after only a couple of weeks.  I was sent a replacement monitor.  That one doesn't produce a tracing that is of sufficient quality to determine the rhythm.  I can see QRS complexes and I can tell if the rhythm is regular.  But P waves can almost never be seen (even when I know I am in sinus rhythm).  Very disappointing.  I was hoping to be able to recommend the device for my patients.  I hope the reliability of the device can be improved because if it could it could help a lot of people.",

Also I have a case for my iPhone 5 but there isn't a case for the iPhone 6s.  I bought what looks like a stick on addition which ruins the look of the phone and provides no protection for the phone.  I recommended to customer service that selling rubberized cases would provide some cushioning for a phone but was told that the cases aren't advertised to protect the phone. No kidding! But isn't it a good idea? The idea is that you have the capability to check heart rate anytime you have your phone with you so doesn't it make sense to protect this expensive device and make it look good, or at least decent?",

We were not able to capture my episodes during the monitoring because I didn’t have one during that time. Cardiologist gave me all clear and said my heart was fine. I wasn’t convinced. It just didn’t feel right. So I bought the Kardia Mobile device just to give myself peace of mind. I captured many “episodes” on my device that read as AFib. I sent the reports to the Kardia Mobile cardiologist who confirmed I was having AFib. I went back to my cardiologist who confirmed I have AFib and I am now being treated for it. Although I was having panic attacks I was also having Afib episodes and this device confirmed my suspensions which led me to proper care which I feel possibly saved me from a stroke or worse.",

The technology of this device is incredible.  AliveCor could not say if it was compatible with my LG model G7 ThinQ phone because they had not tested the device with that specific phone.  Regardless, I purchased the device and it is compatible with my phone as well as with my wife's IPhone.  The device is easy to set up, and fast and easy to operate.  The results compare favorably with results from EKG in cardiologist office.  Most of my readings  are indicated to be Possible AFib, with occasional Unclassified readings.  Readings for my wife, who does not have any known heart issues, are indicated to be Normal.  I email the charts to my cardiologist on a weekly basis.",

We've been able to send PDFs to our doctor and it has saved us a few trips to the ER, so it paid itself off quickly. Unfortunately it's not calibrated for children, so the alerts for Afib etc don't apply to my son, but it still gives accurate enough readings for whether or not he's having tachycardia (which I, as a person who is uneducated on reading EKGs, base my judgements only on heart rate). Our doctor is careful to remind me that the alerts are not accurate and I shouldn't put too much stock in what this says.  I'm proud to say I've only called the doctor in an unneeded panic once.   I like to use it as a log of events--I take notes on the EKGs when he's sick or looking pale. I recommend it!",

        "comment": "The EKG gives a good waveform and has built in filters to remove noise, flip the signal if you have the device upside-down and detect atrial fibrillation. I like how you can turn the smoothing off and that you can email a PDF of the printout.  The ability to have a technician or a doctor interpret the data for a reasonable price is useful for users without formal medical training.  My main complaint is that customers cannot email a CSV file with the actual data from the EKG, as it would be a smaller file than an image and would allow customers to plot the data themselves if they wanted to.  I also wish the product came with a carrying case to protect it.  Another useful optional accessory would be wires with alligator clips to attach electrodes, which may make it easier to remain still while using the device and yield more-accurate information.",

        "comment": "Mobile AliveCor did not work very effectively for me until about two weeks ago. More than 90% of my readings were put in que and never resolved. hat experience reduced my willingness to use the App.  It seems to be working better now.  Only 1 in 4 or 5 readings have not produced a reading.  The App is not too difficult to use, but requires that one take time to figure out - it is not widely intuitive.  For me, that's somewhat of a problem.",

        "comment": "The system does work.  The phone app was easy to setup.  Wet finger tips starts the recording and it records for 30 secs.  You can save the recording and also send to your doctor if you want and print out s hard copy.  It only diagnoses three things, AFIB, tachycardia, bradycardia and also normal.  The finger tip pad is very sensitive.  The slightest movement will cause the recording to stop or give a few flaky waves.  If it stops you can start it over.  This is not the same as a multi lead EKG but it is a way to monitor between dr visits.  It is also not a substitute for a Cardiologist.  I am sure it is not 100% accurate but it does seem to be helpful.  I have been to the cardiologist yet to compare to their EKG machine, but I will on my next visit.  I will also show my hard copies to the dr. also.  I have been using this for about 4 weeks now.",

I keep a record of my arrhythmia episodes so he can see how long and how often they are and with the AliveCor printed readouts, he can see exactly what my heart was doing. My readouts are part of my medical record. They have greatly helped in deciding my treatment path. AliveCor helps keep atrial fibrillation in my chest and out of my head.",

        "comment": "The AliveCor app works pretty well. But a few comments. 1. Needs a battery voltage monitor from within the app. My unit stopped reading and only after checking the coin battery with a voltmeter was I able to know I needed a new battery. Worked fine after that. 2. Adjustable sensitivity? My fingers sometimes do not give a good connection. Bigger pads? (I have big hands.) 3. WiFi interference. The app should stop and say there is too much interference  to get a reading. Like it does if your phone is being recharged.  Saying that I still think the app is great. We are gone for 4 months in the winter and I asked my cardiologist about afib returning, after conversion.  He said it depends on the degree of afib. I've lived with irregular heartbeats for some time but also experienced doubled pulse rate. He said when in doubt just send him an AliveCor reading.",

Over time I could see his heart rate becoming more erratic and even stopping for a minute after he climbed his stairs to his room.  This past month he started getting dizzy spells and collapsing at his dentist's office and at his dermatologist's surgical room.  At first I thought it was due to anxiety but four days ago he was dizzy and fatigued when he woke up in the morning.  His KardiaMobile show a very rapid prolonged heartbeat that was getting faster and faster so I called 911.  Turns out he has atrial fibrillation, ventricle dysfunction, and severe stenosis of the aortic valve.  I strongly believe the KardiaMobile device saved his life.  Now he can still look forward to his 100th birthday!",

I have a health watch, but that does not give me the rhythm - only the beats per minute.  This is easy to use and I can take it with me anywhere.  My only problem is that I have Raynaurd's Syndrome and my hands and fingers go numb, so I have to wait until the circulation returns to use the device.",

Neither my PCP or cardiologist were familiar but impressed when I showed it to them.  Like to find out if there is a Medicare code for them if they read the ECG.   I have recommended this to relatives who have heart issues.   I ordered the cover to fit the Iphone.  This is too flimsy to protect my Iphone.  I end up holding the device on the bqack of the phone.  I was getting some reads with no diagnosis.  I suspect I was not holding the sensors tight enough.  I am getting the instant diagnosis now. I have recommended this to relatives and showed this to both my PCP and cardiologist.  Neither had knowledge of the device.  I think there is a Medicare code for the doctor to read.",

Scared me so I went to my primary physician. He got excited and ordered an EKG in office to compare and came back shaking his head. Stated I do not have AF and no indication of it at all. He  was not impressed with Kardia. I am open to the fact maybe I have a bad sensor or reader on mine........",

The sensor uses a 19KHz audio carrier to communicate to the I-Pad and apparently the electronics is sensitive to the 2.4GHz Bluetooth signal.",

So monitoring them with AliveCor and sending the info to my cardiologist helps with deciding if any treatment is necessary. It also puts my husband's mind at ease, knowing there is a way to get information to the doctor when it happens.  If you go to the emergency room or make a doctor's appointment you are already better and there are no symptoms for them to monitor or test. Thanks",

The device and app have changed our lives and gives a wonderful sense of security by giving immediate and surprisingly detailed information.  Being able to send results for evaluation to AliveCor, or directly to my cardiologist creates immediate solutions for concerns.   It is an astonishing device and program.",

Suddenly and for no good reason my phone was removed from the compatibility list.  I contacted AliveCor but there was no resolution. Now I have a worthless Kardia device unless I buy a more expensive mobile phone.  My Motorola phone is fully updated with Android version 11 but it isn't \"good enough\" for AliveCor.  So much for reliability of a product.",

My heart appears healthy on imaging but I fluctuate between slow and rapid heart rates, accompanied with significant chest pain. I can’t keep going to the ER so I bought Kardia and it’s been great! Thank you to the creators! It’s a game changer and essential for ppl with heart problems who want to take control f their own health.",

It is easy to use and the information is beneficial for those who have a history of atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation.  Occasionally, the AliveCor will fail to save the first reading of the day, but it usually will save the next reading taken and it is not  big issue with the unit.  Great value for money and an excellent way to monitor your heart health.",

It is great to be able to get a rhythm strip instantly, anytime, anywhere from my patient and they can send it to me instantly.  Because they nearly always have their cell phone on them, I think this device is superior to a holter or event monitor for very infrequent or episodic palpitations or rhythm disturbances.

I record my EKG every morning to track my resting heart rate and have a 'before' trace available in case I go into a-fib. I think it's a great, in some ways revolutionary, medical device. Highly recommended.\n\nThere is one thing with the app that annoys me. It won't let you record an EKG with NFC on, so every time you go to record an EKG, you have to go into your settings and turn NFC off, then when done recording, go back into settings yet again and turn NFC off.  Like more and more users, I use Google Pay almost daily, which requires NFC. So, every day I have to go through several extra steps to turn NFC off and on. It would be great if the app turned NFC off and back on for you, automatically, as controlled by a Kardia settings button.",

I have atrial tachycardia and atrial fibrillation, neither of these have been caught by the app or the cardiologists reading the clips.",

It’s a little bit difficult to get used to putting your fingers correctly on the pads, but you get the hang of it really quick.  There is no replacement for going to an actual doctor/cardiologist but I can tell you, this thing works if you’re looking to monitor for basic heart arrhythmias.  It’s a very impressive piece of equipment and will make a great addition to anyone who worries about their heart.",

It brings a great deal of insight for patients trying to sort out their various symptoms that may or may not be related to their arrhythmias. Having this insight makes living with arrhythmias, particularly AF much easier. I am a believer in converting acute AF from an unexpected medical emergency to an expected managable nuisance.",

        "comment": "I am a retired anesthesiologist. I had been aware of occasional \"skipped beats\" for some time, which were never caught on ECG in the doctor's office. When I heard of AliveCOR, I hoped it would enable me to \"be there when it happened\" and record whatever was going on.\r\n\r\nThat is EXACTLY what it did for me. First, occasional atrial ectopy; later, variable P-wave morphology, occasional dropped beats and short runs of tachycardia. Eventually, 2 bouts of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.\r\n\r\nIronically, on the basis of these findings that *I* recorded, my cardiologist arranged for a 30-day telemetered recording _ which did NOT happen to catch any AFib. But on the basis of the AliveCOR tracings, I was started on apixaban anticoagulant.\r\n\r\nAbsent my AliveCOR recordings, we would still be \"up in the air\" about this diagnosis.",

My heart beat was acting up the other day, and I immediately went to the KardiaMobile to measure my EKG to send to my cardiologist, and it kept not reading my heartbeat. It said there was no signal, however, the device was right next to my phone, not near any phone charger or anything (apparently that affects the signal). It has happened a few times. There also is nothing to protect the device. There is a clip that sticks to your phone, but there is no hard case around it to protect it. So if it is bouncing around in my purse, or if I lay my phone down, it is going to wear out the device. The case that clips to your keys is also not a hard case, so if it is crushed by someone putting something on my keys when I'm not looking, it'll damage the device.",

I talked to two of the cardiologists that have treated me and both told me the same thing. The algorithms in these devices are very good and give an accurate reading. Use mine a couple of times a week or when I sense an unusual heart beat. I tell all my friends and relatives to monitor their heart health with their doctors on a regular basis, because you never know what is going on inside your body until it's too late sometimes. After all I had my first heart attack when I was only 38 and yes it took me by surprise . This little device is worth every penny if for no other reason than peace of mind one gets with having an accurate idea of how their heart is behaving.",

If I try them one after the other the older one consistently sends a stronger signal to my iPad than the newer model does.",

The upper right hand corner is cracked a bit and sometimes catches in my pocket. I hope that does not become a problem. I have come to depend on the device to monitor my AFIB issues and give me a good sense of what is happening and for how long. My EP Doc has used my emailed reports to assess my status.

My doctor stated my fibrillation was dangerous, so we did an ablation, now my heart beat is so slow they worry I won't wake up (28bpm resting). This device helps me to more accurately see when the heart is off or simply slow. The majority of heart rate monitors out there today, unless you buy a medical grade 12 lead EKG machine, cannot come close to the accuracy and information this device can provide. Especially in mobile form, this 30 second EKG reader is a unique and potent tool for understanding your QRS signature and the manner your heart responds when you are out living your life.",

It is imperative to get a reading right away. Plus the unit has to be in a particular position with the phone for it to work correctly.

This not only gives peace of mind; is it Afib or benign arrhythmia, it also means you're not attached to a cardiac monitor or an ILR to document what you feel.  I wish I had this 6 years ago when a cardiologist dismissed my vital signs, symptoms for 'anxiety or menopause'.  Thank you!  Change the settings to 2 minutes so you clinician has a better read.  Skip the BFx - it is confusing.  Add the ability to save or not save instead of going back to delete.  A flat monthly rate for x number of readings by tech and/or cardiologist in addition to a per EKG price.  Would to show 'benign arrhythmia' and 'tachycardia' in addition to 'NSR' and 'AFib'.",

I was also able to upload it and he reported back, talk about a time saver and life saver.  Great news to report, the beats are abnormal, but not afib, come to find out it was due to Nasacort.

        "comment": "My cardiologist wanted me to get the AliveCor app because I had symptoms that were very elusive and he needed to get some sense of what a diagnosis I had. AliveCor was able to finally catch A-fib in one of my ekgs.  The doc was able to then prescribe the correct and appropriate medication for my heart issues which helped me greatly. I am grateful that I was able to get the information necessary to make me feel better.  I take EKGs most daily and on days I am not feeling well I take several. It is convenient and I get answers quickly. My cardiologist gets them quickly also and is able to make any adjustments needed to get me back on track. Of course nothing is perfect but AliveCor provides me with a safety net that I greatly appreciate.",

Funny, but it worked well until the last AliveCor upgrade.  As for the Weekly AliveCor Report, it has never printed correctly on paper.  The email reads correctly, but when it's printed part of the daily results are always missing on the first page.  I have reported this more than once but still have no results.  This is not an issue with the phone OS.  I really wished the report printed correctly.",

Porting the sensor to a new phone would be a nice feature (sees stuck to my old case).  However, when I did use the sensor, and then the app, what I always wondered was, \"I wish I could see a month at a time, and whether trends were improving or not.\"    Think of it like the Apple Stock Ticker app.  You can see just today, but with a swipe you can see the stock trend over 1Q, 1M, 1W, 3M, 6M, etc.  The analytics make the app.",

        "comment": "I like the AliveCor Mobile ECG and the follow up reminders and service approach of the company.  However the device itself is very inconsistent at being able to record a good ECG.  I often have to try 5 or more times to get an acceptable reading.  Most are \"unreadable\".  I've tried different finger tip positions. Moistening my finger tips, using a sonic transmission gel on them, using a slightly salty water solution and moistening with various lotions.  All have been inconsistent.  My doctor gave me several 3M Red Dot transmission patches that have been the best help, so far.  But, I still, often have to try several times to get a readable result.  The product is generally, pretty good and useful.  But, the process is a little frustrating.",

        "comment": "I would highly recommend the AliveCor phone app and monitor. I have lone AFib and my episodes happen several times a year. While I know when I am in AFib without the AliveCor, I find it very valuable to track the episode. My cardiologist is also pleased that he can review and assess the episodes.   It is very reassuring to be able to check my heart rhythm if I suspect that AFib may be occurring or if I simply want to track my heart activity during or after exertion.  I believe that anybody that has AFib would benefit from having the AliveCor.",

This device lets you know immediately if you are in A-Fib.  I told my cardiologist that I had purchased this device and he thought it was a great idea.  He said he had heard nothing but good things about the Kardia.  I am so happy I purchased this great device.  Just one important suggestion, if you have dry fingers and hands like me, I strongly recommend wiping them with a baby wipe prior to trying to take a reading!  When I first purchase the Kardia and tried to get a reading, I would get either no reading or it would switch between no reading and a weak reading.  I saw the suggestion and it completely solved the problem!",

This device is no substitute for see your doctor, but it does allow for a quick self-check after exercising or more strenuous outside work. It works with my Android phone and the app that I downloaded. It never fails to communicate with my phone and the app. I assumed that my physician would disregard the records-- but actually he looks at the records on my phone and old me to keep using it. (I am not saying he endorsed it, but he said he would look again at my next appointment)",

        "comment": "I bought my Kardia EKG after learning of it from my cardiologist. Two months later, it documented a recurrence of my hereditary atrial fibrillation. As a physician, I knew the tracing showed a fib, but I still had it read by Kardia's board-certified cardiologist on call. The cardiologist had 24 hours to read it, but mine was interpreted in about 24 minutes. I obtained two other EKGs that evening. One documented a rapid ventricular response, which fortunately did not last long.  The third EKG documented a return to normal sinus rhythm after the medications took effect.  Based on this documentation, my cardiologist changed my medications and I have changed my lifestyle. I recommend this device to my own patients with episodic atrial fibrillation.",

It is small so handling it is not a problem.  It was recommended to me by my cardiologist as a way for me to check my vitals. You can add additional items to your Kardia if you choose and interact with a knowledgeable person if you need to. As someone who was most likely misdiagnosed years ago it has given me the peace of mind to get off of my medication and be able to administer an EKG at any time.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Without buying the extra add-ons (with monthly charges), this device is much less useful than I thought it would be. It starts off each reading with wildly fluctuating markings each time I use it only to declare “normal sinus rhythm” even when I can FEEL my heart skipping beats. And it can’t detect a heart attack—which is probably 90% of the reason most people buy it in the first place. Read the fine print before you buy. What they tout in advertisements you only get at considerable additional cost so the $79.00 price quote is misleading.",

It will detect some types of arrhythmia for the purchase price, but to get access to more types you need to pay a subscription.  Could you imagine a doctor telling you that they've listened to your heart and will tell you part of their assessment, but to get their entire assessment you'll have to pay an additional monthly subscription?  Unbelievable!  Capitalism without compassion, I guess.  I think that's lame!",

The wave forms with the enhanced filter is very smooth and the morphology is very consistent between individual complexes. Some times I get electrical interference, but interestingly if I open up the battery compartment and reposition the battery, it seems to go away. I would certainly recommend this to any one who would like to check their cardiac rhythm or PAcs vs PVCs etc, but would not recommend this  to diagnose heart blocks, MAT,u waves etc.",

I have had 12 cardiversion and 2 ablations, with a 3rd ablation in the works. I have shared my use of this device with several of my heart doctors and several of the staff in the Cath Lab.

Running water in kitchen or hissing sounds from industrial HVAC systems make obtaining readings difficult. Ambient sounds affect pattern. Positioning Kardia device with respect to microphone may render reading inverted. Just flip it around 180 degrees to fix. But I love having this device and I use it all the time especially when my heart develops symptoms. It’s been very accurate with doctor visit EKG comparisons.",

I have an ICD, and am at risk for Atrial Fibrillation, so any arrythmias may cause me a shock, or may even cause a stroke.  That is why the Alive Cor is so handy.  Now, I can just run a strip and send it to my doctor, and I can respond accordingly.  If it is nothing, I can go back to whatever I was doing, but if it is urgent, I can go straight to the E.R.

Normal. I wasn't feeling bad or in pain, just a little sweat. I tried it 10 more times before it convinced me to go to the Emergency room, they hooked me up to the professional unit and the doctor walked in and said yup I that I was full blown afib, and asked me what symptoms I was having, sweaty And the kardia mobile.

This has been diagnosed and treated by a cardiologist, but we wanted to be able monitor at home.  When I tried my normal cardiac rhythm it showed a normal EKG, perfect.  However, when my wife tried it, it showed a EKG that was almost completely flat, with just a little blip where there was probably a VPB.  Since this would not show an accurate, readable EKG for her, it was worthless for us so we returned the unit.\n\nWe should mention that we were not attempting to view EKG for the the conditions that the unit is specified to diagnose, like A-Fib.  It's hard to say whether would recommend the unit since it may work very well for the conditions it specifies, but it didn't work for us.",

        "comment": "Your programmers took the easy way out in designing the ECG display.  Instead of imitating the familiar format of traditional ECG devices (where the pen is fixed and the paper scrolls) they made the \"pen\" move across the screen and \"jump\" back to the left when it reaches the right edge.  This is disconcerting and really unnecessary.  It should be fixed a.s.a.p.  The \"delete\" option is unnecessarily hard to find. It should be more clearly marked.  You should provide instructions for how to best remove the \"sticky stuff\" from the back of the device for users who don't want to attach it to their phone.  You should contact Starkey and work out the incompatibility between your software and theirs. While my Starkey hearing aids are active, your app does not \"hear\" your 3rd generation device.",

I think it's great that you get a monthly report from AliveCor that you can save/copy/print and take to your Dr. appt.  Great for those of us who feel our hearts \"skip beats\". Also, AliveCor provides a wonderful opportunity to \"get to know your heart\". I did not realize my heart rate is as low as it sometimes is.  Thank you, AliveCor, for being so easy and informative.",

My cardio just dismissed the PACs as normal and nothing to be concerned about. With the ability to accurately monitor my PACs, I determined that the PACs were a side effect of amlodipine and got my primary care to change my Rx. With no amlodipine I have no PACs! My doctor thought the AliveECG was so cool he bought one for his son who is in med school.",

        "comment": "I have intermittent and rare AF that is not symptomatic.  I carry the Alive Cor with me in my travels along with the various meds I take, and when I'm uncertain about my pulse, I use it.  It's very easy to use and certainly provides excellent rhythm information.  However, p wave detection is only intermittent (even when I'm in sinus rhythm), so it's of little help, even when I use it with a small tube of electrode paste that I also carry.  Non-the-less, It's a valuable accessory and worth the cost.",

        "comment": "When you install the app, it requests permission to use the microphone in your tablet/phone.  I believe the link is audio.  My EKG monitor worked out of the box.  As signal strength weakened, I replaced the cr2016 battery.  Signal strength was strong but ALL recordings were \"unreadable\".  I found that with a new  battery and strong signal, the monitor HAD to be a minimum of eighteen inches away from the tablet/phone.  Then it worked fine again.  Understand that this is the less expensive model, that works with two finger contacts.  The other model includes a bottom contact for your left knee  in addition to the two finger contacts.  It gives more sophisticated readings.  Recordings are saved to your tablet/phone OR you can buy a  service that will upload readings to your doctor or cloud.",

        "comment": "Sending my ECG directly to my doctor enables me to be less anxious when my heart rate varies. It makes me more confident and keeps me  from running to the doctor or urgent care center.  When I talk to my doctor he can easily give me advise over the telephone of how to tweek my meds. He can then see how the subsequent change is or is not working.  It was frustrating to me when the mobile device did not work when I was on vacation and then when the battery went. It was too complicated for me to change so I was sent a new case.  It is also helpful since I live in two different states and can share the results easily with both doctors.  I am still amazed that my readings can be sent wirelessly. This is a positive use of technology. I hope I can continue to use it after the 6 month study ends.",

        "comment": "I bought my Kardia mobile two years ago after my first incident of atrial flutter. It gave me great peace of mind while I maintained normal rhythm. Then when I experienced a second episode of flutter, my mobile confirmed it and I was able to provide detailed info to my cardiologist. After a successful ablation to correct my flutter, I again relied on my Kardi mobile for peace of mind. But now all I get are unreadable results - interference when I'm in a silent room with no electronics nearby, crazy looking tracing, and constant \"did Walter record this?\" I find it coincidental that I also CONSTANTLY get asked to upgrade. NO! I don't need that. I just want the device I bought to work properly. It may be time to get a smart watch with built in ecg because Kardia mobile is clearly not the answer.",

I was told to set the interference check and after that I was getting better results. I seem to notice however that if my heart rate is below 50/min that I likely will not get an evaluation. Sometimes the medication I am on lowers my heart rate into the 40's. My cardiologist seemed to be impressed when I showed him the readings. He ask me to record my EKG results with a blood pressure reading on the chart he gave me. Also, I think I get a better reading with only lightly touching the sensors. I think that the doctors could use the results, but they are not set up to automatically receive the records and filter the information to the patient's record yet.",

SVT is tricky to diagnose, so it mostly has to be caught at home on your own. We are hoping to catch a reading on the Kardia so that I can officially be diagnosed.

I can now review EKG to monitor any symptoms for myself as well.  New changes in your program with warnings and regularity of rhythm seem useful, but I do keep getting AF warnings in tracings that cardiologists say is not AF.  Further development of that protocol appears to be needed (unless I need another cardiologis,t which I doubt?)",

I've had two cardiac ablation for AFib and rely on AliveCor to monitor when I do not feel well and document for my cardiologist.  Saves multiple trips to the doctor.  Would greatly appreciate the above mentioned improvement to the system.",

I am in healthcare and to me the rhythms seem very accurate. I wouldn't hesitate telling someone to get this if they are ever concerned about the heart rhythm.  One caveat is that if you want to know if you have any other abnormal rhythm, you will need to pay for a premium service. To me, I only needed to know if I am having a-fib or not and that is a free service that comes with the device.",

This cost each time. Then I found out later that I didn't need to pay that at all that it was already being processed each and every time. Why make it so unclear as to what you should do. And who was getting the money each time I had it read? I was doing 5 or 6 readings a day thinking that I had to pay for each and each and everyone. this wasn't right.",

You have to take your recordings into your doctor to be read.  So it is useless as a real time device.  If you are in a-fib and your heart rate is over 50 bpm, it will analyze the recording (but or course, you will already know you are in a-fib).\n\nIn short:  If you have a slow resting heart rate, this product is not for you.",

        "comment": "I am a physician and recently converted to atrial flutter. I spoke with a tech at AliveCore. The EKG cannot discern flutter from normal sinus rhythm but will pick up fibrillation. I am satisfied with that honest answer and purchased the device for post atrial flutter to NSR( normal sinus rhythm) and documenting it. It's worth the $ and peace of mind and I am impressed that the techs are available 7 days a week. I would recommend googling a normal EKG and looking at atrial flutter/fibrillation and the difference between the two, for your own edification.It's not a perfect EKG but is always at your finger tips, if you'll excuse the play on words.It seems a lot of my friends have discovered this great technology. Thank you Live Core.The support number is 855-338-8800",

I did not want to bother with a formal holter monitor, so I showed it to my Cardiologist and he was impressed.  Later in the month, my afib really went to on tear and all runs were captured on my AliveCor device.  Faxed the strips to my Cardiologist and on meds and now much better.  Speaking from experience, as I am a Board Certified Emergency Physician, it really helped me out.",

Easy to carry at all times in a pocket or billfold without a hard case, not as easy with one but still fits in a bag no problem. Getting a strong signal can sometimes be wonky, which would not be fun during an episode of erratic heart rate, but it will still get a good reading even on a weak signal. Not sure you need the $9.99 monthly subscription, but at this point I’m keeping it.",

One way to make the experience even better, would be to offer some videos that explain beats fluctuation and why sometimes the reading is \"unrecognizable\".  One other idea for a video would be to explain why the heart beat varies from time to time.  I love this device and am hopeful in time you will continue to add new features.

Who knows how many episodes I would have continued to have if I hadn't used AliveCor.  I also have PVC episodes and it is a quick and easy way to distinguish between the two.  Best purchase I ever made!!!  I strongly recommend it for anyone with heart arrhythmias.",

If normal,  details are not needed in a mass screening as patients may need to use it each time they came in. If there is an abnormality an alert could be made by the phone and it would ask for name and details for follow up by staff.",

One definitely has to hold it in a stable, relaxed position, since it's very sensitive and picks up the slightest movement or muscle activity. (I'm GLAD it's sensitive!)  I can't address the interpretation service, since I've never submitted a tracing.  Great investment.",

I use it once a week or so to check for A-Fib, but more often to check my heart rate after exercise or strenuous activity. This gives me peace of mind and negates the need for a special exercise watch that provides pulse monitoring. This unit is trivially easy to use and has worked great over the past couple of years. All I've had to do is change the battery once.",

But it is easy to use, and gives different results for different people, showing that it is reading something rather than making up a picture and palming it off. As with many apps like it, it is a starter app, and gives the user many opportunities to pay something and join their club. So  far that seems unnecessary for us. We may take one if their ekgs and show it to my wife’s Dr. to see if agrees at all with what he gets on his machines.",

But my brother, who had a heart attack last year, was able to get a good reading and ended up keeping it for his own monitoring.  My only issue was all the phones had to have the cases removed in order for the product to get a quality signal to get a good reading.  So that is going to be an issue having to remove the phone case every time you want to get a reading.",

I guess that's a good thing, but it's hard to tell if this thing is really checking my heart and recording it accurately, or if it's just something I wasted my money on. I know it was recommended by my cardiologist and approved by the FDA, but it's hard to imagine that what I'm seeing as it's scanning is really \"normal\". Also, if I could do one thing to make it better, I would add the ability to read my oxygen level. Having Asthma along with heart problems, that addition would be greatly appreciated.",

It's so pleasing to see normal sinus rhythm.  (Your cardiologist or PCP can show you what to look for in a 2 min lesson, and you can find on-line references to refresh yourself.)  And when I did have what looked like an episode of AFib, I was able to email a PDF of the ECG to my cardiologist so he could see what I was seeing, rather than waiting to go into the office and sit at the machine and probably not have an episode while they were looking at me.  It's a great tool that's helped me stay calm and manage my AFib.",

Recently, after recording 3 ecgs over a period of an evening, night and morning, I called my cardiologist, asked him to check the ones I had sent and after doing so, he sent me to the hospital for a cardio version.\r\nYou ought to pay me a commission on any that have been sold because of my telling others about it and showing them how it works.",

It was recommended to me by my cardiologist. \nI used it a few times and sent my results to my doctor as soon as I got it to be sure it was working correctly. She received it as soon as I sent it. Since then, I had a few episodes of irregular heartbeat and some fluttering. I sent the results and she read them and assured me there was no indication of serious heart problems. I also like that I can keep the strip in PDF format for future reference.  I have had irregular heartbeat for many years. \nAt least I know the device works.",

Having the KardiaMobile has been great to periodically check to ensure my heart has maintained with a regular rhythm and not gone back to AFib.    \r\n\r\nWhen I had a question to my cardiologist about reducing my blood pressure meds, I mentioned I had this device … and he asked to see a few of the results.  Nice to know he finds the product that reliable.      \r\n\r\nWhen I was having issues getting readings, I called support and they deemed my unit needed to be replaced and they sent a replacement immediately!!   Very impressed how quickly they send a new unit and stood behind their product.",

        "comment": "My wife was in ICU with heart failure due to months of undetected AFib, the cartioligist recommended Kardia to home monitor her AFib. After being home for two days we hooked up Kardia to her iPhone in 2 minutes we sent the first reading to alivecore and within a few hours had the reply with the ekg letting us know she was back in AFib. We were able to get her back to the hospital and address the issue before the heart was redamaged. As she has no symptoms with AFib we rely on Kardia to monitor her rhythm and prevent heart damage. Note: after the initial reading by alivecore cartioligist, all other readings are immediate and e mailable to your own doctor.  We rely on it, we trust it. \nThe Fullers",

My only complaint with the system is the requirement to log onto the website each time before I can use it.  That becomes tedious after several tries and many failures.  I am 81 years old, and the tiny type on the phone is almost impossible to use without at least one typo when typing the password.  What is the reason for that requirement, if I only want to review it myself, and don't want to have the results reviewed by your team?",

Saw a cardiologist who couldn’t see the issue after all the normal tests. He told me to buy a Kardia and showed me his. A few months later I had an episode that lasted 7 hours and got multiple EKG’s. I now have a diagnosis of AFib and have an ablation scheduled soon to fix it. Thanks Kardia. It never happened in the doc office (or the ER! It stopped right when they hooked me up) so this machine is a lifesaver. Really grateful I never had a stroke before buying this!",

The ability to assess an ECG at bedside has made a big difference in the number of people I have sent to the ER. The calming ability of showing someone they are not having a heart attack is greatly under reported. I have also helped identify electrolyte imbalances and heart block incidents bcz of its accuracy during events while waiting for equipment and labs. This new generation appears even more user friendly and is a must to update to as I update my phone after 2 1/2 years of use. It was ordered the same day as my preorder for the iPhone 6S and I could not imagine upgrading and not having this ability in hand.",

I have used it multiple times a day through these years of heart rhythm problems. It has worked for five years with a few battery changes. I’d love it! It has never malfunctioned! I have used it on friends, and one friend credits this device for getting him to a cardiologist and saving his life.I have not paid anything but the original price and do not feel pressured to spend any money while using it. It generates reports I can take to my doctor. I highly recommend this!!",

I can't even say what peace of mind it's been able to give me, relieving the stress of wondering if I was going back into AFIBs (I used to go in and out of AFIB 20-30 times a day).  Now I know that the palpitations I feel are PAC's, it is a great relief.  The only recommendation I would have is that it would be nice if I could trace for longer than 30 seconds, and then stop, capture and record it when I find the 30 seconds I want examined.  I miss many events I could have captured had I been allowed to wait for it.  Instead I have to stop, delete, and then go again.  So that would be helpful.",

My cardiologist is the one who recommended I purchase Kardia.  I'm fortunate that I can feel when my heart goes into AFib but I completely rely on my Kardia to let me know how fast and how erratic my heartbeat is so I can make the decision of whether or not to go to the ER for cardioversion.  I now have a second Kardia which I carry in my purse for those times when AFib starts and I'm away from home.  It may sound funny, but Kardia is my lifeline!",

This is important to me since the problem I'm trying to get a handle on is intermittent and of short duration most of the time. When I get a recording that I need to share, I simply email it to myself, save on my computer, and send out as needed. It is easy, even for a technology challenged person. The images are clear and easy to read - if you know how to read ekgs - I am a rank amateur, but it is still helpful to me. I didn't purchase the version that alerts to more rhythms - I just send on to the doc if it isn't NSR.",

This is esp important when I'm in a remote location like the middle of China as I was recently.

Though it is specifically designed to detect atrial fibrillation, it is also useful for determining overall heart condition in the comfort of your own home. Definitely not a substitute for medical EKGs.\nIt can be tricky to get it to read properly on the phone app, keeping the phone and the EKG Monitor very close together allows it to read properly,\nFor me, the subscription service at $10/month is not beneficial, but it could be worthwhile to someone that needs to track their heart condition.",

Occasionally it can't record an ECG due to interference - I've never been able to identify the source of said interference.  My cardiologist was pleased with the reports - although the backup cardiologist at the VA was simply confused by the monthly report.",

        "comment": "As an easy single-lead EKG machine, this device works reasonably well. If your only diagnosis is atrial fibrillation and you own an iPad or iPhone, then you really should have this. My only reservation is that the signal is just not clear and steady enough for several other diagnoses. There are many other electrical problems that can affect the heart, but this device is not much help with them. Still, it has its place. I use it for routine monitoring at least once a week, and I am very glad to have it. When used together with an inexpensive blood pressure cuff, it can give you peace of mind when you are doing well, and warnings to head to the ER when you are not. Just remember that it cannot possibly replace a full EKG.",

However, the second one I received worked great, it was small and easy to use. It has all the information for the doctor to decipher for you to make sure you are healthy. It's not something to rely on out, but it does give peace of mind for certain health conditions. I'm giving it a 4 stars mainly because sometimes it will spit out randomly out of range data, but the solution to that is to test multiple times.",

Download the app, connect with bluetooth, and place both left and right hand middle nad index fingers on the lead and you can watch your heart rate cardiogram. There is a subscription portion to this which allows you to detech othr heart issues, but I think the basic would be good enough for most people. And if you're really worried about your heart, I would pay for the subscription. Allows you to PDF your EKG to send to your doctor which I think can be useful. You don't need an apple watch to do EKG for your heart, This one does it better and only $70 when I purchased it. 5 stars if it came with premium subecript free for at least a couple of months.",

I trust it meaning when I get a trace I feel that it is valid. The one continuing problem I have is that people have trouble holding it so that it works. I hold it and it initializes but then they hold it and nothing. back and forth as I coach them \"Not so tight\" or \"Tighter\" and clean or moisten the contacts. I do like the new feature which gives an opinion - Normal - if it is. Overall I am very satisfied with my Alivecor and would buy it again.",

It's not very intuitive, and sometimes I have to search for the right input areas. Filing is definately substandard, it would be grand to be able to search under last or first names, or an alias. I would greatly appreciate a more stable baseline. The ECG doesn't appear to become \"quiet\" for too long, and any muscle movement aggravates the baselilne, causing adventitial \"events.\" However it is greatly improved from when it was first introduced.",

A friend, who also happens to be an Electro Cardiologist, suggested your product just to monitor my condition.

After 2 months AliveCor monitoring the results indicated I might want to consider options other than just treating my condition with pharmaceuticals.

Both devices give me the same nature of results; I can't tell whether the 6L is more accurate or more sensitive, they both seem to detect the same kinds of irrythmias.  The KardiaMobile is easy to use at work, it just takes a few seconds, using two fingers, at your desk.  The KardiaMobile came with a felt carrying case with magnetic closure, included in the box.  At first I didn't quite understand how the KardiaMobile works, it doesn't use bluetooth it uses some sort of high frequency audio to communicate with your cellphone app.  So your cellphone has to be nearby and the microphone can't be hidden from the KardiaMobile, they have to be fairly close to each other and sort of pointing at each other, then they can communicate just fine. I find the real-time results so useful to understand what's going on.  This is so much more valuable than an annual check-up or a one-day Holter Test.",

I wasn't anywhere near any other electronics or transformers.  My next try in the same location worked, but the graft was all over the place.  Tried all the suggestions given by the company online and have yet to get a clean graft.  The quality of the device is good, but you have to pay extra if you want a carrying case.",

The associated Kardia iPhone app records measurement results locally which enables the information to be conveniently presented to your cardiologist or GP during routine visits.  An optional subscription facilitates storing of the EKG measurements in the cloud.  The only criticism, in terms of usage, is that a firm/heavy pressure must be applied and maintained to the electrodes during the 60 second measurement period.  Placing the device on a table or firm surface is mandatory to avoid miss-reads.",

        "comment": "Product is a great idea, but the electrode piece is too small to comfortably just sit and place your fingers on, and too easily moved to interfere with getting a good ekg. I have a prosthetic aortic valve and I’ve yet to get a good ekg from it since purchase. All I get is that my readings have too much electrical interference no matter where I sit to do\nThis. The idea was to purchase this device and use it to create EKGs and send them to my cardiologist on a weekly basis, but with no readable ekgs that all went out the window. My advice is stay away from this device until they improve the size and stability of the electrode piece of the equipment.",

        "comment": "The AliveCor is truly excellent.  \n\nWas introduced to it by my cardiac surgeon after my first cardiac ablation to monitor myself.  Six months after being weaned off the Amiodarone, the unit picked up another AFIB.  Of course it was a weekend, and only the on call cardiologist was available, but here was the magic...  He said...\n\n\"Ok...  relax your arms to get a clean strip and TEXT it to me...\"   Don't come to the office, don't go to the ER, just relax your arms, get and clean reading and TEXT it to me....  Now that is the future of medicine.\n\nI've taken over a thousand readings with my AliveCor over the past 4 years.  Best investment I ever made.",

        "comment": "I bought Alive Cor and also got an iPhone on my doctor's recommendation. He had seen it at a conference and wanted to see how it worked.. I found it awkward to use because of having to attach it to my iPhone with adhesive. The adhesive was poor and made my phone sticky. I had thought I could use Alive Cor to send ECG tracings to my heart doctor for his evaluation,  but instead kept getting dunned to send my ECG Tracings to someone, not my doctor, to be evaluated for a stiff price, not covered by insurance. This product taught me an expensive lesson: Don't let your tech-happy Doctor talk you into something expensive  because HE wants to try it out!",

        "comment": "I purchased the AliveCor app with the electrodes after I had a round of A-Fib.  I am a paramedic and have lots of experience in reading EKGs.  The AliveCor app generally does a pretty good job.  It is obvious that the initial reading has lots of artifact, but there are algorithms that seem to eliminate most, but not nearly all, of that artifact.  Generally, what's left is a fairly decent version of lead 1, but there are still lots of movement anomalies, regardless of how still I am during the reading.  It is more than adequate for finding basic arrythmias, however.   I would purchase it again, but hope that they continue to work on the algorithms.",

The Alivecor plastic case started falling apart a couple of years ago; it's been glued and taped together with electrical tape many times. The unit still works! The Kardia upgrade is not fully compatible; some of the Kardia features do not appear on this older phone, but many do. It records reliably. There are some abberations on some recordings which appear to be frequency interference related, but once you figure out what they are, it is acceptable. I like the unit. A thumbs up (except for the case).",

        "comment": "Purchased and started using early January 2015. Using 3rd gen unit on HTC One M8 and two Kindles. All three work well but it takes practice to get good conductivity. I worked 40 years as a printer and washed hands many times a day. My fingers are dry and thick, rough skinned. Finally found using a little salty water on my fingers and letting it dry enhanced my conduction on the pads. Tried moisturizers and other lotions but suspect residue actually blocked conduction.I now simply lightly blow on my fingers (like fogging a mirror) and that adds enough moisture to get good reading. The price of the unit is far better than anything else on the market.",

The good news is my carotid artery went from 73% blockage to 79.5% CLEAR. The Doctor and the technician both were shocked by the changes in the arteries.\r\nThen I showed both of them my KardiaMobile.  I was in Atrial Fibrillation a number of times in late November. Which is the leading cause of Strokes.\r\nMy EKG History with the KardiaMobile records has now been downloaded to my Cleveland Clinic My Chart.\r\nYes, I am on a blood thinner now but I am thankful that we caught this in time.",

        "comment": "I was diagnosed with Bradycardia and was unsure whether I might need a Pacemaker. Using AliveCor I've been tracking possible symptoms, Bradycardia and PVCs for about 9 months now. I find it to be a very reassuring resource and like that it saves my ECGs so I can share them with my Cardiologist. The one drawback is that it really cannot get a functional ECG in noisy environments. I cycle along some rather busy roads and occasionally would really like to check for PVCs. Unfortunately road noise prevents me from being able to do so. Beyond quiet interior spaces I find that it can be challenging to get a good ECG. Very happy to have this device, though!",

        "comment": "I think the only real time monitor is a chest strap which could be combined with the Alive Cor and a smart phone.  The problem with the Alive Cor is one has to be still to take the EKG, thus stopping exercise and not getting a reading that reflects the heart working during exercise.  Recently, while using a chest strap on my stationary bike, I caught the very brief racing heartbeat I occasionally feel.  I was cruising along at 120 BPM and suddenly felt my heart racing for a few seconds.  The strap picked up 159 BPM.  I have never been able to capture that with Alive Cor because the racing stops before I can get Alive Cor to read it.",

However, what I didn't know was that you really only get one function with the product as it stands, and you then get offered a subscription to be able to get more data out the device.  That was a bit disappointing - especially since you know the device is collecting your health data but not telling you the results unless you sign up for a subscription.  Five stars for the product. Five stars for the ease of use.  Zippo for the lack of transparency.  As for the \"recommend\" I said \"yes\" but I was really looking for a \"yes, but....\" option.",

        "comment": "Happy with the Kardia since mid 2019, after it became clear I had afib. It should be a staple part of the first aid kit. I can hardly explain how useful it is. The Kardia makes me less anxious, as I can be in permanent afib and I want to make sure I am not calling the hospital for nothing. Sometimes the pill in the pocket works and after testing with the Kardia I could let the cardiologist know that my heart had its rhythm back. This week I had to have a cardioversion and using the Kardia for accuracy I can let you know that the values were exactly what the monitor showed!. The battery lasts a long time too. 1 changed recently and I make a lot of EKG’s.",

My cardiologist recommended it, because I was having palpitations in my heart that could not be explained, all the tests were performed did not show any problems, but I was not having the palpitations at the test time. When I purchased kardia, I was able to test myself at the very moment of the palpitations, and guess what, I have a heart condition, now I can take better care of myself, and the doctor prescribed a medication that will help me live longer. Without kardia I would have not been able to know and the condition could have killed me. Thank you alive for kardia! It is a great product.",

I had an implanted heart monitor for 13 months and did not feel comfortable keeping it in for another 3 years as recommended after my heart ablation surgery which so far has been successful-I have not had any worrisome episodes for afib and since this loop recorder (Heart Implant) monitor migrated more to my breast area-I did not want to keep it in since I had abnormal mammograms in the past. So far I have been checking my own heart with this less invasive device which is easy to use. I check 2x a day and feel so relieved that I have had no more episodes of afib or other related rhythms.",

It's almost impossible to use it when you feel anxious because you'd just had palpitations or Afib. I would say that 3 out of 10 results taken when I was calm look correct. The rest have results are all over the shop (like, really, impossibly distorted). Even when you catch anything you have absolutely no idea if that was your heart or another problem with the machine.\nNot to mention that you will become obsessed with checking your heart EVEN knowing that the results are unreliable.\nI'm very unhappy about wasting my money for that product.",

To borrow an analogy, this device rectifies the \"sorry, ma'am, we can't duplicate your problem\" you hear at the mechanic sometimes about your car. You feel something, you grab the AliveCor and record it. Simple as that. He has had extensive treatment at the #1 cardiac center in America, and the medical professionals there were uniformly impressed with the strips the device produces. Well worth the money. We don't leave it attached to the phone, just keep it in its own bag and hold it in the close proximity of the phone when recordings are needed.",

I am asking many of my patients to look at the website, phone application and electrodes embedded in the phone protective case, and it is giving me clinically important information that I was unable to determine previously with 4 weeks of monitoring. Obviously, the events must be long enough for the patient to record, and the patient must be awake and conscious to record them; but in the vast majority of events this is a wonderful addition to heart rhythm management.",

The only want to treat the symptoms and “watch” the condition, while resorting to drugs to mollify the patient (or worse, to shut them up.)

It is not a substitute for an office EKG, but it is easy, fast and accurate way to detect irregularities in your heart rhythm. \n\nMost people will be satisfied with the free KardiaCare account. It will also allow for guest readings.\n\nOne caveat: Look at the list of supported devices. It does not work with my Moto G Stylus, so I use it with my Samsung tablet and an older Moto G phone. \n\nHighly recommended!",

While the app was fun to use, I ultimately stopped carrying my device due to the annoyance of the high pitch sounds it emits. I'm about 29 years old, and most of my friends and colleagues (myself included) could hear the squeal. When I set my phone on my desk. From my pocket. From my car mount. It was awful. A simple on/off switch would have gone a long way. I don't mind the sound when I'm actively capturing a reading, but I'll have to wait 5-10 years before the device stops annoying the hell out of me when I'm not using it.",

I understand this is considered a medical device and its functionality must be verified. However, AliveCore needs to either step up its certification program or give us a warning screen to click through. \r\n\r\nAliveCore, why don't you have an annoying warning come up every time you use this with an unsupported device? \"I understand I am using an unsupported device. I could get misleading results that could be life-threatening\" Something like that. \r\n\r\nGreat device, poor support.",

        "comment": "I purchased my Kardia Mobile just after Christmas after discussing it with my cardiologist. He did not recommend it because the average person would not likely know how to accurately read an EKG. In my case I am married to an RN retired after 40 years. Believe me, if I was left to my knowledge, it would be pretty useless in my hands alone. Medical professionals have years of training in reading EKG and there are a lot of subtleties in an EKG that my wife has a difficult time explaining to me. I'm not a dummy, I was an Architectural Designer for over 38 years. This may not be beneficial to the average lay person. Purchase with caution based on your medical knowledge.",

        "comment": "Hi,  I love being able to record my own ECGs.  It gives me peace of mind when I feel little cardiac \"hiccups\".  The strength of my heartbeat varies, so I would like to capture the avg and strongest heartbeat during a recording. I have HCM, so my strong heartbeat does concern me.  I'm not crazy about the results I've gotten when I've sent my ECGs to you to review.  Both times I had unusual events captured, and your online cardiologist service reported normal sinus rhythm.  It would have reassured me if your cardiologist would have said normal sinus rhythm with environmental noise captured, and include a suggestion to put my phone in airplane mode while using Alivecor.",

        "comment": "Since I had had an ablation in 2011,  I did not have to do all the fancy monitors to try to \"catch\" an episode of my paroxysmal AFib to qualify for a second ablation.   With AliveCor, I was able to document my episodes and email them to my cardiologist, to qualify for a second ablation in 2015.  This saved so much time, inconvenience, expense, and anxiety.  I also really appreciate having it with me, at home and our travels beyond our state and country, to verify what I feel.  I am amazed at how well it works and how easy it is for me to use when I am not a techno savy person.   Thank you to whomever developed this.",

        "comment": "I always say that the worst thing you can do with an ECG is hold it by the electrodes. That said, if you don't have shaky hands, are looking for gross rhythm issues (AF, runs of VTach) then it's pretty useful, assuming the rhythms are persistent.   I don't trust the filtering for ST segment or QT interval analysis (and anyway you need several leads for that). The signal is just too smooth.  I find it annoying that the device has to be so close to my phone. I like to use it 'off-phone' and the range is very limited.  Being able to move it around the torso would be useful so i could explore several leads sequentially.",

Although this doesn’t provide a comprehensive EKG, but it sure gives any user a basic baseline and if there’s a fluctuation, then it can detect it and be enough of a reason to seek immediate  medical help (i.e., urgent care, emergency department).\n\nEspecially for those without a series 4 Apple Watch (as it features an EKG also), this is a much cost effective alternative. The only downside is having to pay for the premium membership, which is a bit too pricey.",

But I'm not able to see the rhythm when it happens. Very easy to use and can sent a strip to the  Dr.. Can carry with you anywhere and works with your phone or tablet. The app has other ways to help track your help. This can be a life saver. I'm a Retired Paramedic and know how to read the rhythms. You don't need to know how to read them. It is able to pick up on some important rhythms. If you have heart issues, I say this is a great buy.",

My cardiologist recommended your product but unfortunately getting him copies is anything but straightforward-he has no work email so a couple of additional goofy steps are needed to get him involved.  Nothing in your information/instructions prepared me for navigating with that missing piece. Also  the instructions for your monthly plan are lacking/confusing  After almost 2 weeks using your product, I’m still not sure what to do, what options are available or if it’s worth the monthly fee.",

The core purpose of this product is to get the information into the hands of a healthcare professional but you have to go through flaming hoops to do that.

Rather you have scroll  down for that option, then select \"Download PDF\" which doesn't actually download a freakin' PDF, then you need to open the report in Acrobat, go to the ellipses, scroll down and select \"Save a copy\", then select \"On this device\" - what the heck?  Who developed this use case?  This is absurd.  Download a PDF should do just that in one click.  Period.",

Having congenital heart defects has meant that regular monitoring has been a necessary and inconvenient burden for much of my life, but now with AliveCor ECG I have the freedom to go anywhere in the world (or off it!) and at anytime take an ECG should I feel the need. I proved this point recently with a 15 day trekking/climbing expedition in the southern Andes. My team members were impressed with the small size and the ease of operation. The fact I could use it on either my smartphone or tablet was an additional bonus. Thank you for this (potentially) life saving device.",

When they came available to the public, I had to get one.  While my afib isn't severe or frequent, I use my device regularly when feeling the little flutter-flutters flapping around in my chest.  Easy to use, and I feel confident in it. You have to accept the fact the there will be some funny-looking artifact at the beginning of the tracing, but once it gets going it is a breeze to use.  I've taken it into other doctors' offices to show it off, and nurses in particular love it.",

        "comment": "I suffer from occasional Afib that has been fairly well controlled with Metoprolol for the last couple of years. But the Afib incidents have begun to increase over time and I was beginning to worry about them. My cardiologist suggested Kardia Mobile and it seems to be working very well. I have a new Samsung Galaxy 21+ and it is not yet listed as a compatible device with Kardia Mobile since they have not had time to test it out yet. However the Kardia Mobile device seems work just fine with it after I downloaded the Android app. Kardia Mobile is quick and easy to use and seems accurate. When you are not quite feeling right, it is comforting to find out if you are in Afib or not.",

        "comment": "I'm impressed by the performance of the Mobile ECG. I use it frequently to check for paroxysmal afib. My episodes are infrequent and can be difficult to identify, since my medications tend to minimize easily felt rapid atrial flutter.The Mobile ECG has been very useful to verify those few occasions when afib \"breakthroughs\" occur. On several occasions where a definitive reading could not be obtained, I've sent the ECG to AliveCor for analysis, and the response was very rapid. My only complaint is that the small unit is somewhat sensitive to signal \"artifacts\", which can result in non- definitive readings.",
