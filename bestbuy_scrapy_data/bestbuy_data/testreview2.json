        "comment": "I purchased this as a tool to help monitor my grandmother’s heart because she has had issues over the past couple of years and not to mention her 3 brothers and my grandmothers father all had Congestive Heart Failure and 2 out of the 3 brothers died from CHF. My grandmother has a very significant arrhythmia that you can actual identify when listening with a stethoscope however it did not register when I used this device. That was what first threw me off. So I tested it on myself, friends, family etc and it was correct about 80% of the time. It just so happened my grandmother had to go in to the hospital for another issue but she was hooked up to a “6 lead” EKG 100% of the time, in addition to a blood pressure cuff that was always attached and periodically took measurements and the finger sensor to check her blood oxygen saturation levels. (All of these wires hook in to a monitor that records all the different values and an alarm will go off if your levels go outside of the set ranges)— so when I went to see her I brought the small Kardia device with me and I took 6 different readings. All panned out every 10 minutes and I got a printout from the monitoring device every time I used the Kardia and for the most part, it was accurate HOWEVER it did not pick up on the fact that she has “chronic congestive heart failure with preserved ejection fraction” aka “diastolic heart failure.” In order to diagnose that you need either a 6 or 12 lead EKG. What was even more offputting is that it never once picked up here very obvious arrhythmia that she’s had since her 20’s. \n\nThis device is a 1 lead EKG. It’s picking up the basic electrical current that flows through your body. This device also only programmed to pick up on 6 different heart issues. There are WAY MORE than 6 abnormalities that the heart can exhibit signs of via an EKG. For the most part a 6 lead is truly what you need. That pick up on peripheral electrical signals that run through the body. A 12 lead is the REAL DEAL but most of the time, not truly needed. As we grow older, yes of course a 12 lead helps pick up everything including the electrical current that runs through our extremities.\n\nLastly, and the final straw that convinced me to return it is that they avidly market the product as “FDA-cleared” (which doesn’t even come close to being “FDA-approved”) and even though they market as being “cleared” there is no evidence on their website regarding clinical trials and testing and results and comparisons. At least not that I could find, and if there are testing results on their site that I happened to missed, I still would have returned it. They also have no indication on whether or not they are seeking FDA approval. To me, that says “we will continue to say we are FDA “cleared” because most people don’t know what the difference between cleared and approved and let’s continue to sell a device that’s fancy but not entirely  accurate. Being FDA cleared just means that the FDA has recognized the device as being very similar to a predicate already being marketed and sold on the market and that the device is not harmful in any way. AKA-the FDA has verified (through an independent lab group btw, not their own government labs) that the product won’t kill you and that it’s relatively similar to another product on the market. That’s it. I am a big believer in math and science and when it comes to medicine I want to see facts, results, lab tests, clinical trials, etc etc. I won’t touch this product or any of their others with a 10 foot pole until I either see “FDA approved” or some scientific clinical information showing the efficacy of the product.",

        "comment": "I bought the Solis unit to be used as a portal mobile Wi-Fi in my vehicle as some places that I travel through for my job are not always cell friendly. There is a particular stretch of rural highway that I travel frequently where my Verizon cell goes to zero bars in spots. I had success with a built in AT&T Wi-Fi in my previous vehicle but my replacement vehicle did not have a built in so I purchased the Solis as it advertised that it would automatically lock onto the strongest network in the area. Needless to say, I have been extremely disappointed. In the areas that I need it most, it will take a very long time to lock on to a signal and will not always stay locked in. This is especially frustrating when I'm supposed to be on a Teams meeting for work while driving. I called tech support and explained my issue and told them how the previous AT&T Wi-Fi unit I was using had very little trouble in this area but for some reason the Solis would not lock onto the AT&T signal on a consistent basis. I was told to do a reset on the unit. That really didn't work. Sometimes the unit would work fine in the rural areas but it would not lock in on a good signal on a regular basis and I got tired of pulling over to try to work with it. I think this would probably work fine as a \"sit in one place\" device in an area that is not out in the middle of nowhere...although AT&T still works there......but as a mobile Wi-Fi for your vehicle, it's awful. Since I've had it for almost 6 months, I guess I'm stuck with it so I'll use up the data I've pre-purchased and then do who knows what with it.",

        "comment": "I researched hotspots prior to some lengthy trips in Europe this last year. Skyroam was newer to the game, but strongly recommended. I've had the, \"puck\" nicknamed after its hockey puck shape overseas 9 out of 12 months. ES, IT, England, FR, DE, Switzerland, Amsterdam, Belgium, Iceland, Sweden, Thailand and Norway. No problems at all. The shape fits in your front pocket easy. Doesn't slide around on a car dash. At first, I wasn't sure of the color, but it's easy to not lose because it stands out. The cell phone app works great. Easy to turn subscriptions on and off at will.\n\nAustin helped me with a technical glitch. The puck was using a Spanish IP address when I was in DE. Triggered my security software with my bank. Austin remotely reset the device, problem solved. Quick turn around with tech support if you need it. I got a regular USB C charger that tops off the battery in 2 or 3 hours.\n\nI'm completing a cross country European tour this Friday. 1900 mile road trip. No glitches from cell tower to cell tower or crossing borders. \"The puck is tough!\"\n\nMy sister's friend borrowed the puck for a trip to Thailand. No issues either.\n\nI cut the cord with cable TV. I'm considering cutting the cell service and using Skyroam exclusively with my cell in airplane mode using wifi. It'll work for my home wifi TV's at home.\n\nI think the biggest advantage to Skyroam over activating your cell phone overseas is that you can have 5 devices on hotspot versus just one using my cell. This worked great for traveling with a small group.\n\nI've had 3 of my close friends buy Solis after using my hotspot. It just works so well.",

        "comment": "My Solis Lite has not been able to connect to a signal once. That is not an exaggeration. I feel like I was tricked. I bought this device for working while I travel around the globe. I bought it as a backup in case my hotel wifi goes out or I want to work at a cafe for the day. That way, I could still get my work done.\n\nThis bad review can be broken into 2 parts. 1) the device does has not worked once for me. 2) customer support said the device would work in the countries I needed it to work in.\n\nBefore I purchased, I contacted the support team to see if the Solis Lite works in the countries I would be visiting. The support team confirmed the device worked well in those countries. My trip consisted of visiting Nepal and Albania.\n\nUnfortunately, the device does not come close to living up to the marketing on the website. The website claims that the \"Solis Lite is the perfect hub for any on-the-go lifestyle. You can stay online anywhere to navigate your journey or share moments anytime.\"\n\nWhile the places I am visiting are not the most popular places in the world, the Solis Lite website claims that their device works in those countries and their customer support confirmed that to me pre-purchase. I am not sure where their device works in the country because I've tried using it in 5 different cities all around the country. The only place I haven't tried using it is in the capital, which I am not planning on visiting.\n\nWhen I have contacted customer support, they claim that the area I am visiting is \"very rural\" and that is why I am not getting a signal, even though I am traveling through decent sized cities.\n\nI would not recommend buying this device based on my experience. Maybe it works in the United States or major European capitals.",

        "comment": "I am a retired physician with some weird heart rhythms and wanted to be able to check my status between checkups.  It is very frustrating to experience feelings of my heart skipping beats, yet by the time I get to my doctor’s office for my next visit, my rhythm is stone cold normal.  This device allows me to capture pictures of my heart rhythm when it is acting up.  Then, if it is necessary, my doctor can order a 12 lead EKG, or a 24 hour Holter monitor to fully assess my rhythm.  It is invaluable when such rhythms are sporadic, since you can capture the irregular rhythm and relate it to time of day, activity, stress, caffeine, etc…. This device does not replace a 12 lead EKG, or a 24 hour monitor, but it does an excellent job of identifying the 4 basic concepts of heart rhythm interpretation.  Fast; Slow; Regular; Irregular.  It also does a fairly accurate job of allowing measurement of QT intervals, QRS width and, in many cases, the differentiation between PVCs and PACs.  You need to have a physician’s opinion for true identification of these issues, as well as things like heart blocks and brief periods of A-fib, but to get you started and to monitor yourself between doctor visits, this device is very much worth its purchase.  I use it for home monitoring for my family.  I am quite pleased with this device and am glad I purchased it.",

        "comment": "My dad has A Fib and he was having issues with RVR, rapid ventricular response. We were looking online for something that could up us identify if his rhythm changed and when he needed to contact his doctor or go to the emergency department. We purchased the  AliveCor Kardia device and loved it!  One night we were hosting family game night and we were so excited about our new technology toy that we thought it would be fun to do tracings on everyone there!! It was all in fun and amazement at the new cool technology gadget!! However things became serious when my cousins husband who was completely asymptomatic and had never had heart issues had his tracing done. It was not what we were expecting. We discovered his heart rate was 144 and the device suggested \"Possible A Fib\". We were very concerned and repeated the tracing several times with the same results. This device is not a doctor but it can tell you when to call your doctor or go to the Emergency Department. So my cousins husband did not take it lightly and had further testing done which revealed he had 4 cardiac arteries blocked. His widow maker was 100% blocked!! He underwent quadruple bypass surgery and has recovered nicely. He was completely asymptomatic and we truly believe that this device saved his life. Thanks AliveCor!! We are firm believers in your device and so glad that it is available to the public.",

        "comment": "I am extremely glad to have an Alivecor to check my heart rhythm to determine whether or not I am in Afib.  I appreciate the capability to email the readings to myself at a different email and print the readings to share with my doctor.  He does not do email.   I like being able to record the activity before the reading or how I feel.  I am now enrolled in a cardiac study at Johns Hopkins Hospital.  They are giving the volunteers an Alivecor to take readings and able to be monitored by the study staff.  I figure Johns Hopkins has confidence in Alivecor.  Three cons with Alivecor.  First, I wish the phone case was a bit stronger to protect the phone.  Second, there should be more detail in the analysis.  There are three choices, Normal, Unclassified and Possible Atrial Fibrillation.  I understand Normal and Possible Atrial Fibrillation.  I don't understand Unclassified.  There may be some limits imposed by the FDA.  However, I would like to know some of the parameters that might fall under Unclassified.  I have figured out that Unclassified may include bradycardia beats under 49 bpm and tachycardia, beats over 100 bpm.  Not sure if I am correct.  What is included in Unclassified between those numbers?  Third, the response to emails for diagnosis do not contain enough detail.  Responses seem like canned messages.  These are minor.  The device provides confidence knowing I am in rhythm. details for my doctor when not in rhythm.",

        "comment": "My wife and I live in Rio Vista, Ca. Her cardiologist advised us to buy the AliveCor device because of her SVT attacks. Several months later, in October 6, 2016, she had what she thought was a bad SVT attack. We used the AliveCor with the Kardia app and it indicated she was in AFib. She was hospitalized two days because of its severity, but no heart attack. Cut to Nov 9, 2016, around 8:40 in Palm Springs. I'm using my smartphone, when I experience burning indigestion discomfort. Take anti acid, but it worsens. Feel pulse in carotid and it's erratic. Use the AliveCor and it registered unclassified, three times in 5 minutes. I know what my normal ECG looks like and knew I was in trouble. I called 911, EMT arrives 5 minutes later, does their thing and 10-15 minutes,  I'm in the hospital heart attack. Within another 25 minutes or less, I'm have an angioplasty procedure to remove a 90 percent blockage to the Left Anterior Descending. Little to no heart damage. I can't say enough about the AliveCor. It has already saved my wife's life and mine. \nRecommended Improvement:\nCurrently the device reads Normal, AFib or Unclassifief. I'd like to see a Possible STEMI, or Possible Heart Attack reading. \nI talked up AliveCor before this happened, but now I'm telling everyone in their 60s to consider purchasing it. One other thing. The medical staff in Palm Springs was amazed when I showed them my readings and easily identified PVs and the STEMI.",

        "comment": "I am a Physician Assistant who works in a 30+ bed/24 hour a day urgent care.  In the past 3 years I have seen many patients in \"A fib\".  Many had know idea anything was wrong.  Some came in for anxiety, palpitations, and some for chest pain.  Those who knew were \"paroxysmal\" patients suspecting recurrence.\n\nAs for me, I figured a Pneumonia, and boy was I wrong!!!  Out of the gate I had afib RVR, or \"Rapid Ventricular Response\". In lamens terms, your heart's bottom half is accelerated or accelerates with minimal exertion.  This can lead to V-Tach, venticular (the bottom half) tachicardia, which if left un-treated is a \"lethal rhythm\" as it is known.  Even simpler terms \"not good\" :-)\n\nFor me, I now back in \"Normal Sinus Rythm\" thanks to an electrical cardioversion.  This is where a surgeon or ED doc drugs you up (if you are lucky) and shocks your hear out of A fib (again, if you are lucky you heart complies).  \n\nI now have a history of A fib, and if it happens again to me I will have \"paroxysmal\" A fib.  God forbid it does not convert one day, then Chronic Atrial Fibrillation.\n\nMy low risk at 46 years old and otherwise healthy means I won't take blood thinners most likely.  This means I need to know if I go back into A fib quickly so I can go get shocked right away. The Kardia is going to let me do that by my taking my tracings every couple of days or with suspicion.  \n\nIt is now the most powerful tool in my very recently changed life and I am 5-star grateful to have it!!!",

        "comment": "Like the \"Wizard of Oz\" scene, AliveCor is hoping reviewers focus on the smoke and mirrors of its device and not what's behind the curtain. The device works well enough, and if that's all you base a review on, \"wow it's a 5!\"\n\nBut even more important than taking a recording is reporting those recordings to your doctor, and this is where AliveCor falls on its face.  The reporting capability both online and on your phone a woefully pitiful. Your doctor will laugh at you while cursing AliveCor.\n\nLog onto their website, and the first thing you notice is that the online reporting offers no way to search individual reports - you literally have to scroll through potentially hundreds of readings to find a particular tracing. Your doctor will love that!\n\nWorse, the website inaccurately aggregates reports.  In one test where half the reports were SR-SVE and the other half SR, it failed to list any of the SR-SVE!  Only by scrolling through hundreds of potential tracings can you identify individual results.  Imagine your doctor fiddling around on a website trying to find which recordings to examine?  AliveCor is clearly more focused on the flash of its device than the usefulness of its website to physicians.\n\nI can go on, but you should be getting the point. Most reviewers who have given AliveCor a favorable rating have only focused on the flash of its device.  No one seems to pay attention to what happens when you want your doctor to review those recordings.  \n\n...And that's where AliveCor falls flat on its face.",

        "comment": "Most noticeable is that the AliveCor device contact pads are easily dented and scratched indicating that metal used is dead soft and not of a harder grade metal or plated with a hard coating to make the device more resilient being so exposed.on the back side of a cell phone.  The plastic holder for the AliveCor has two small \"flex bending spring ears\" at the lead-in of the holder if th we AliveCor device is removed from the holder....those spring ears protrude slightly and because they are rounded off and are of a slightly higher profile first one got snagged and broke off then the second one saw the same fate. Now I must watch that I don't lose the AliveCor device altogether. It has already slipped out of the holder and dropped waist high to a hard surface causing me to hope the AliveCor device has some \"g\" shock survivability built into it.  Regarding the output...the waveform displayed shows almost too much sensitivity to the point my Cardiologist has said \"so much background static in the waveform produced that it bordered on almost being useless\".  The Dr is the one who recommended AliveCor and now considers it \"a toy\" and not medical grade enough for him to the point that a Medtronic LINQ Loop recording device was implanted within me at his recommendation. The AliveCor device also responded that a possible AF was recorded when my Cardio Dr. quickly and easily identified the recording as having many PAC's in it indicating with the Dr. now saying that the algorithm programmed within the AliveCor was not able to distinguish between a series of waveforms that were indicative of AF from that of a series of much less harmful PAC's in the recorded series of waveforms. So too many false positive AF feedback.  I have owned and used my AliveCor device since Sept. 4, 2015.",

        "comment": "We live in a very stressful world and life isn't getting easier. \r\n\r\nI've been to the ER more than once because of episodes of tachycardia, shortness of breath, elevated BP, a sense of imminent doom: those of us past middle-age and many younger people know the routine. Each time I was there, an EKG was part and parcel of the standard tests they ran to rule out a heart attack. \r\n\r\nNow, I never had a heart attack that they could find or even a mini-stroke. But I worry a lot and that's just the way I am. When I heard about Alive Cor's device, I was curious but held off because it was being promoted as a tool to help those afflicted with diagnosed AFIB. And my physicians have never found AFIB. So, it seemed logically contradictory and also a waste of $99 to buy one. But I did. \r\n\r\nAnd I this is only the second day of owning it, but I feel better. Aside from having a family history of stroke and sleep apnea, worrying about the possible scenarios and consequences just made me feel bad, even though nothing was really wrong.\r\n\r\nWhat the KardiaMobile provides me with is the assurance that I can check if I feel a little \"off\" to see if I have a normal EKG or not. I can have a history of my normal EKG's on file to compare with any future ones and while the device isn't for self-diagnosis, it can help me to decide whether or not I need to seek further medical assistance. The best part is that the test is quick and you can take as many \"snapshots\" as you want. Alive Cor has changed their policy so that you can save your tests for yourself at no additional cost. The only fault I found seemed to be based in the newest version of Android software. I was unable to record any voice notations. All I got was a loud hiss and jumbled words. So I turned that \"feature\" off until they fix it. \r\n\r\nBut be assured, being able to rule out AFIB, which can affect anyone or to just be able to check for a \"normal\" EKG goes along way in helping affected people or worriers like me feel better. Well worth the small investment.",

        "comment": "AFIB AND TRICKINESS TO GET READINGS. Afib is a heart condition, that I watched my mother struggle with.  Unfortunately she was unaware of what was happening as her mental condition was deteriorating.  Afib is also sporadic and  unless a doctor sets you up on a holter monitor for the span of time it is happening, you never get proof. With an event monitor, you need to know the Afib is happening.  I also found, a typical home style blood pressure cuff cannot accurately detect the erratic heart rate that Afib presents.  You get a error.  Manually you can measure it, but unless you are a nurse  you may not know how to do this accurately. I am not a nurse.  ALIVECOR APP IMPRESSED MY DOCTORS: The Alivecor app and device is literally a life saving option.  If you think you have Afib, you just whip out the sensor (I dont have mine attached to my phone) and start your app and you get a reading.  I had suspected I had Afib, but my primary physician was thinking it was all in my head.  I knew better having researched my Moms condition.  I purchased this monitor and showed my doctor the readings I was getting and finally I was referred to a heart doctor. She was amazed at the technology and felt it was compelling.  This is essential.  Afib can cause strokes and if you get it under control and on a blood thinner you may well avoid any complications.    My heart doctor was enthusiastic to see the readings.  He loved that not only did you get the info, but you also got the trace.  I even managed to get a trace where I converted from Afib back into sinus rhythm. That was useful as there is sometimes issues with this.  I am now being treated for this condition and have scads of data besides the extra tests the doctor put me through.  I feel I can manage my condition as an individual.   SETUP AND USAGE: I downloaded the app and put it in record mode and the first trace was sent to validate the unit and I was ready to go.  I found you cant use it, when it is plugged in and also if you move too much it will mess up the trace.  Occasionally it takes a moment to start a reading, but I have found finger position matters and a few times I had to restart my phone.  Thank you Alivecor.",

        "comment": "I have had an AliveCor monitor for over 2 years now.  It is very useful for tracking long term trends and I know it is highly accurate in detecting Afib.  In my case however, it has misdiagnosed Afib where it did not occur.  It has done this at least 3-4 times. I sent in for a paid analysis and it was confirmed the ecg was interpreted incorrectly by their programming.  I also had an issue where intermittently the device would not work at all.  This started occurring 10 months into my ownership and unfortunately I waited too long (4 more months) to inquire about the problem and was told it was out of warranty.  I was subsequently able to correct this problem short term by bending the battery connections out to make better contact with the battery, but I still have to frequently spin the battery  inside the case in order for it to work, and occasionally bend the battery contacts back out.  I don't have this problem with any other device I have that uses a coin battery.  I do have time periods where I get frequent PVC's, and the AliveCor is very helpful in putting a number on these.  All in all I'm sure it definitely works as advertised.  I'm hopeful that in the future it may also measure other arrhythmias or things such as QT intervals.",

        "comment": "First if you have a concern about your heart racing or pounding, get off the internet, call 911 and get to your nearest hospital!!\n\nIf you are still here, then maybe you only have a mild concern. In short, Kardia is as good as the positive reviews say!! I bought it in store, installed the App and was able to use it right away. I did not pay for any extra subscriptions so I can’t say anything about those. \n\nI will say that my heart was periodically racing, pounding… (I did not think it was that serious.) It was mainly in the evening when the doctor’s office is closed. I looked at reviews, bought it, tried it and saw “unclassified” and “Possible Atrial Fibrillation!” I called my cardiologist and made an appointment. (I probably should’ve went to the ER, but this was early Covid time). I told the doctor about the readings, at first he said “I don’t trust those things.” After my EKG in the office he said “let me see that again.” My saved Kardia reports matched his! He explained how to read the EKG and the irregularities. I now will be taking two low dose medications for life but now my EKGs are “normal” or as they say now “normal sinus rhythm.” I’m alive 2 years later to write this review. Best life saving purchase that I have ever made!!",

        "comment": "Read the instructions!  I'm staying at a hotel and discarded everything but the mouse and battery before I went inside.  The mouse worked at first but stopped working when I rebooted, and wouldn't work in my 2nd installation of Windows 10 on the same laptop, nor on Windows 10 on my ARM-based Samsung.  After 15 minutes of scratching my head, I finally realized that you need to press and HOLD (not simply turn on) the Bluetooth button for the computer to see, pair with, and connect with the mouse.  Then it comes up instantly as Bluetooth Mobile Mouse 3600 and stays connected after rebooting.\n\nOne minor complaint is that you can't easily switch the mouse between two running instances of Windows on separate laptops.  What happens is that the mouse will connect to one and remain paired on the other.  There is no way to reconnect without clicking \"Remove device\" and holding the button again.  After all of these years, Bluetooth still feels like a half-baked technology, at least in Windows.  You would think Microsoft would put a \"Reconnect to paired device\" in the Bluetooth settings.\n\nI wish the mouse came in exciting colors like cinnabar red or Persian green or zaffre blue.  Black is so boring.\n\nFor me, when rebooting, there is a brief, almost unnoticeable loss of connectivity immediately after logging into Windows when the Bluetooth icon first appears in the system tray.\n\nI bought this particular mouse for 3 reasons:\n\n(1) My favorite mouse in terms of comfort and precision is Microsoft Mobile Mouse 4000 so I wanted to try another Microsoft product.  I find most Logitech mice too complex and unwieldy at the high end, and too flimsy and plasticky at the low end, and haven't found my personal Goldilocks with their mice.  \n\n(2) The back of the box says this mouse is compatible with Windows 10, macOS from 10.10.3 onward, and Android from 4.4.2 onward.  No mention of iOS or iPad but 3 out of 4 is pretty impressive.\n\n(3) My much-despised ThinkPad T480 company laptop only has two USB 2.0 ports and a tiny (for me at least) M.2 SSD.  I'm often working with massive files and folders as a cell site tech.  Up until I bought the Bluetooth Mobile Mouse 3600, every time I needed to transfer data from one external USB hard drive to another (because there's not enough room on the internal SSD), I had to disconnect my Microsoft Mobile Mouse 4000 and use the dreaded, glitchy trackpad or (gasp) the red nubby snazzlefrazzum and I would sometimes inadvertently move dozens of folders to the wrong locations or delete entire folder trees in an unintended fatfinger calypso dance.  The bluetooth mouse solved this problem for me brilliantly.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Gimbal was awesome! There is a learning curve, I recommend watching some YouTube tutorials about how to use the different modes. Also get a monopod and you can really do some amazing shots!!! I only returned mine because I have a Pixel 6 and the volume buttons are to low on the side/almost centered. That is a Pixel design flaw because all clamp phone accessories to be balanced smash the buttons down. Do to Google's flaw of button placement the clamp had to be placed lower causing the phone to be unbalanced. My older Samsung Phones worked perfectly fine with the gimbal.Will repurchase another one when I get new phone with normal button placement.",

You get what you pay for. \n\nI also love their app and all of the many features it has. The app also has step-by-step tutorial videos. Took some time to learn & some practice. Definitely worth having though. I bought it for my business.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Great gimbal for a beginner such as myself. I originally wanted to get the OM6 but realized I'm not a pro, nor a consistent video maker so the OM SE fit my criteria. The benefit is that it has some features from the OM6 such as the active track 5.0 and some physical buttons on the gimbal itself. Only gripe is that the gimbal cannot go a full degree of motion on certain angles but that seems to be the case for most gimbals anyways in this price range.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is essentially a gimbal for your cell phone camera. Sure, I've used my cell phones and action cameras over the years for pictures and video, and I've done quite a bit of work using tripods and lighting rigs, but this is the first mechanical stabilizer I've used.  This is way more than just a selfie stick, it has all kinds of capabilities to fundamentally change the way you capture video and images. It was a pretty steep learning curve for me to get used to how it works and how to use its functionality, but I feel like I started thinking like a movie cameraman.  It's just a wildly different experience to have this device control the actual positioning and tracking of the camera and video.\nThe app is full of guides and tutorials, so there's lots and lots of learning material right there available to you. It even can offer suggestions for how you create certain effects and how you use its features.  So yeah for me it was scary to take on this whole new skillset but the app can guide you every step of the way.  I'm still learning and getting the hang of how its features can enhance the content that I create.\nOtherwise this little machine is extremely well built, the motors really do their job positioning that phone in three axes, and it's pretty quiet and the battery lasts a good long time",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] As a stabilizer, this thing rocks.  Videos come out very stable and the stabilizer does a good job accounting for your movements.  It folds down very small and comes with a magnetic phone gripper and legs and storage bag.  If you are lucky to have a phone that you can put the phone grip on in the middle of the phone and have a perfectly balanced phone in the stabilizer, you will have no problems.  If you are unfortunate to have a phone where if you put the phone grip in the middle of the phone in a balanced position, you might have the phone grip constantly putting pressure on the volume button or power button.  Luckily, the gripper opens up big enough that it can be placed over my Google Pixel 7 Pro in a Spigen Tough Armor case and avoids pressing the volume down button.  Instructions are very lacking in the box and will take time to fumble around to figure out how to use it.  The DJI app is not in the Google Play store thanks to embargos, so you have to manually download and install it yourself.  Once you have the app installed and paired with the stabilizer, the app walks you through the entire feature set. Overall, if you can get your phone onto this stabilizer without any buttons being pushed, you will be very happy with the performance of this stabilizer.  Of all the knockoff stabilizers I have tried, DJI really did an amazing job and is well worth the price if you need stable videos.",

Slimmer and lighter with better controls than the previous generation OM4, the OM6 feels good in the hand and works intuitively once you get the hang of the custom controls.\n\nWithin a few minutes of having the gimbal out of the box, I had it working with the app on my iPhone 13 Pro Max (yes it fits in the clamp and the gimbal motors are more than a match for my phone and it's case).  I'm glad they did away with the adhesive mount and only include the clamp.  The clamp holds on tight and is easy to attach and remove without sticking around to ruin your wireless charging plans.  This is another big improvement over the OM4.  I had the OM6 smoothly following our cat around the living room.\n\nThere are so many shot options in the app, but the ability to select and follow a subject and the ability to sit the gimbal on its included tripod (or another full-sized tripod with the threaded mount) and take time-lapse video are my favorites.\n\nStabilization is as smooth as you'd want, even with a big phone and battery life is everything I need - I never ran out of juice in my testing.  The USB-C charging is also very fast, so even if you do manage to run it dry, you won't be waiting long.\n\nIf you're in the market for a gimbal for your phone, it's hard to find any reason not to recommend the OM6.  I use a larger DJI RSC2 for my mirrorless camera, but with mobile camera video quality and portability, I prefer to reach for my phone and the OM6 when I can.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The design of the DJI Osmo 6 is thoughtful. The body feels to be made of a plastic which I imagine would be good for shock absorption but may lead to some durability issues if not treated with care. It folds which is great for portability. While the device could probably fit in a pocket, l think that it fits better in a small bag, purse, or backpack. The controls are well placed and feel very comfortable for one-handed use.  The joystick feels precise. The extendable selfie stick is really useful—especially when trying to get a group shot.\n\nThe magnetic phone holder is another really nice touch. It allows for quick placement and removal on the phone, which is great for situations where you would need to do that like reviewing footage between takes. I didn’t try any of the accessories but they look like they would be nice upgrades.\n\nThe gimbal itself is powerful and makes a huge difference in shot stabilization. If you are shooting in conditions with a lot of movement this is going to offer a serious improvement. Using the joystick to pan is super smooth as well.\n\nThere are a ton of great features included with this product; the most valuable (to me) being the ActiveTrack 5.0. Simply put, the device in conjunction with the app is able to “lock on” to the video’s subject while filming. It works amazing and gives a very specific effect to the content which is heavily featured on Tiktok, Instagram, and other social media platforms. \n\nThe DJI Mimo app is amazing. It works as intended and adds a lot of functionality to the device. I tested it with my iPhone but it works with Android as well. \n\nOverall this is a great device. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a gimbal with great tracking and a number of features.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’ve been considering getting a system like this for awhile.  Particularly for vacations when I want to do videos and those selfies with the wife in nice locations where you don’t necessarily want to go looking for someone to take photos for you.  Overall, the Osmo is easy to setup.  No complications that I recall.  The phone holder looks unassuming and almost too light for the task.  So far though, it’s held my iPhone 13 Pro Max, in case, without issue.  Don’t know that I would try this setup hanging from a vehicle or anywhere where the motion of the carrier would be excessive.  Using the controls is easy but does take some getting used to.  More because this is my first time with a device like this so remember what button to multi-click, to do what, is taking some time.  With more use I’m sure it’ll be muscle memory though.  The tracking feature is nice, but could use some work.  It seems to track me fine if I move from side to side in the shot.  If I standup from a desk position though, it does not tilt enough to keep my face in view.  Not a deal breaker, just something to be mindful of and plan accordingly for.  It’s great they include the tripod, instead of making it an accessory that has to be purchased separately.  It would be awesome if they could find a way to incorporate a tripod in the handle though, so you don’t have to worry about keeping track of that extra item.  I haven’t used it enough to speak to battery life.  The extension is good, but for me it could probably use one more section.  The extension should help get some nice low angle shots.  It is a little bulky.  I think the marketing stuff showing this in folks front pockets is a bit laughable.  It is a good size for a backpack or camera bag though.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The DJI Osmo 6 is an amazing phone gimbal.  I have been using an Osmo 2 for the last few years but the Osmo 6 is a serious upgrade to my previous model.  \n\nSetup takes less than a few minutes, you download the DJI Mimo and pair it with your smartphone and you’re off and ready to go.  A nice new feature of the osmo 6 is that when you unfold it it automatically turns on.  If you need to start recording quickly that is a great feature.  The holder for the phone is magnetic and will stretch wide enough so that you can leave your phone in a case, which my previous osmo could not do.  The osmo will also automatically open up the Mimo app upon connection!  The stabilizer for the phone is much more fluid and stronger than previous models.  Sometimes with my osmo 2 if I didn’t have the phone balanced in the right spot it would kind of flop over and be non functional.  I didn’t experience that at all with the new osmo 6, even with the added weight of a case.  The active track 5.0 is phenomenal and allows you to stay focused on a face or object.  The osmo will keep it in focus the entire time no matter which way you turn it.  They’ve also added the ability to extend the osmo with a retractable arm that will allow you to get more people in the frame or get lower to the ground effortlessly.  The osmo also has 4 shooting modes: Follow, which follows the gimbals pan and tilt movements.  Tilt locked, which only uses the gimbals pan movements.  FPV mode, which utilizes all 3 axes of the gimbal which is the mode I use the most for Real Estate video walkthroughs.  Spinshot utilities the joystick to rotate the camera to make dynamic footage.  Finally there’s a new side wheel which allows you to zoom in and out effortlessly while recordings. All of these features combine for a very good phone gimbal.  I highly recommend the osmo for anyone who needs an inexpensive gimbal to stabilize photos or video.  It really is one of the best products that DJI makes in my opinion.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is a rather impressive piece of hardware.  The folding/unfolding mechanism, magnets to attach the phone and stretch phone mount make it easy to attach your phone and get up and running quickly.  The gimbals and motors really do keep the phone steady/the video stable and it can track people which is a nice touch.  The joystick also moves the phone just where you want it smoothly without jerking and the buttons give you rapid control to start/stop recording, flip the phone from portrait to landscape and other key features.  It also feels good in the hand with a good heft and solid feel without being too heavy which is huge.\n\nWhere it lets down a bit (for Android users at least) is on the software side.  Due to a dispute with Google (and, to some degree, the US government), DJI's app is not available on the Google Play store, and must be downloaded and \"sideloaded\" from their website.  This means that you must enable installing non-Play Store apps in the security settings of your phone, turning off one of the security features of Android (with that setting turned off, it will let you install - purposefully or not - apps from ANY source).  It's also a setting that some corporate environments require you to keep enabled.  So, for Android users at least, this is an issue.  \n\nOnce you get the software installed, either on Android or iOS (where it is found in the Apple App Store), it's a pretty nice experience, giving you quick tutorials on the major features and letting you use some of the buttons to control the phone directly (it guides you through pairing the phone and the gimbal).  Overall, the software is a big plus for the device - BUT I do wish it was directly available in Google's Play Store (DJI, can you work on that!)\n\nAll told, this is a really nice package (with the one caveat about Android users) for those looking to get better video, but still looking to use their smartphones/not invest in an expensive dedicated camera.  You can shoot cinematic looking videos easily and be the envy of all your followers - which is the goal, right?",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] While initially slightly disappointed in the included 'instruction manual', it was made up for by following the QR code and going where I needed.  That'll be an .apk download you'll have to give your phone permission for, but the app is super helpful.  Well that and it's very nearly mandatory for complete, proper use of the gimbal.\nBecause of that, I feel that the app is integral to using this device and needs to be brought up in the review.\nThe device itself is sturdy and has a good weight to it.  Most of the controls will be in easy reach of most users, with only the zoom/focus wheel posing any kind of problem for those with shorter thumbs.  Along those lines, it does seem to be designed heavily toward right-handed use, and that may just be a statistical design choice.  The magnet on the phone clamp feels strong and left no worries that the phone would drop from the gimbal, and the arm is strong enough to hold likely any phone currently on the market.  Controls are simple to use and grasp once you know what they mean, and that's where the app really shines.\nAs stated, the app is pretty much mandatory for proper use, as it connects via bluetooth to join your phone and the gimbal.  Without it, most of the buttons don't properly function, if they do anything at all.  The app, aside from granting full use of the device, grants full use of all camera controls by using the camera through the app.  It also contains a number of templates and such to help make quick movies, with direction on how to set them up and pull the shots you need.  Speaking of direction, you should find your way to the tutorial videos included within the app, as they give a step by step breakdown on how to use the device, what each of the settings mean and are capable of, and how to make the most out of your new accessory.\nAside from the instruction manual issue, my only gripe is that I have to remove my case every time I want to put my phone in the gimbal, as I couldn't get it to function well with the case on--it seems to throw off the motors and the magnet.\n\nOverall, 4.75/5.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] DJI have some of the best drones on the planet. What happens when they take that gimbal technology and introduce it to cell phones? You get smooth video footage in a compact package without breaking the bank in the Osmo Mobile 6.\nI was expecting a much larger piece of equipment. However, this thing is relatively small.  When closed and in the storage position, it is about an inch longer than an iPhone 12 ProMax. It includes tripod feet that screw into the bottom for hands free self-recording. The mount is a standard ¼-20 screw mount that is found on all current photography tripod so you can even use one of those to hold the gimbal and phone for recording. The phone clamp is quite strong an holds the iPhone 12 ProMax with ease to the gimbal with a very strong magnet that will not allow the phone to drop. Also included in the box is a USB cord to charge the internal battery and a suede pouch to keep everything together.\nThe first thing that caught my attention is the quick on feature built into the device. Once you unlock the lock that keeps it from flopping around in an off state and flip up the arm the device turns itself on. This save seconds that could be used to capture the action sooner.\nThe Osmo mobile 6 has four modes for how the gimbal operates. They are Follow, Tilt Lock, FPV and Spin Shot. For most Vlogging scenarios Follow mode is the most used. \nThe DJI Mimo app that is paired with the Osmo has several tutorials that will get you familiar with the use and functions. Also, there are tutorials for shooting specific scenes.\nSome the newer features of this model that differ from the previous version and a smooth operating side wheel for zoom or focus. With a press of the side wheel, you can select either the zoom or the focus function. Another nice, upgraded feature is the joystick control that allows for smooth panning. The third feature is a screen that shows which mode the gimbal is set to.\nOverall if you are looking for a device to get smoother video footage out of your phones camera this thing is great. If you already have a capable smart phone and want to get into vlogging or just shooting more video with your phone that can look more professional, this is probably what you are looking for. \nAll in all another great product from DJI.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is my first smartphone gimbal, so I was super excited to get this Osmo 6 version and try it out.  After a little bit of a learning curve, I love this thing!\n\nRight out of the box, you’ll notice that hard copy instructions or quick start guide material is lacking.  For iOS users at least, that’s not a problem because you simply scan the included QR code and the app store takes you right to the DJi app to download, and the app immediately recognizes the Osmo 6 as the item you’re using, and begins walking you step by step through all the initial setup process, and explaining all the features along the way, in both text and videos.  The app tutorial is quite impressive.\n\nIt uses a super strong magnet base attachment for your phone, that easily expands to fit large phones with cases.  I’m using an iPhone 14 Pro Max with an Otterbox case, and it has no trouble fitting inside the expanding base attachment.  This then secures to the Osmo 6 with a strong magnet, allowing you to securely shoot your videos and photos, and remove your phone in a snap at any moment.  The magnet is strong enough that I have no worries at all about the phone coming off the mount.\n\nControls are perfectly placed no matter which hand you use to shoot with. You have controls for tilting and panning, quick access to front or rear cameras, zoom and manual focus control, preset modes for different shooting styles and a trigger for activating follow mode, to stay locked on to your subject as you or they move around.  Also the buttons have double click features that allow extended options like flipping from portrait to landscape mode in a breeze, or re-centering the gimbal.  It also has a tripod stand for table top placement and a built in extension rod.\n\nIt uses it’s own DJi app for the video and photo controls, which I haven’t had a problem with.  You get more controls over the aspects of your shots compared to Apple’s built in camera app, and you have the ability to customize things like ISO, Shutter Speed, Resolution and FPS, etc.  The controls are pretty intuitive and easy to use, and the 3 axis stabilization really shows in your final videos.  Everything is super smooth and centered, so much better than just using a traditional phone holder or selfie stick.  The learning curve for me was adjusting to the “non” movement of the camera angles that I’m accustomed too, based on body and hand movements while filming.  Letting the gimbal offer precise balance and stabilization is wonderful, it just takes a little getting used to in order to perfect your shooting style with it.  So much fun to play with.\n\nIt has a sold build, and pretty lightweight, not overly heavy, and folds down to a respectable size for travel.\n\nI don’t know that I ever want to shoot mobile video without a gimbal again, and the Osmo Mobile 6 has been the perfect tool for me so far.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] If you’re looking to up your photography or videography using your mobile device, this stabilizer will help you accomplish that! Working the best with the DJI MIMO App and an iPhone, you’ll find you get some amazing features with this gimbal stabilizer. You get 3-axis stabilization, a built-in extension rod, and ActiveTrak 5.0 allowing you to track even the most difficult subjects and keep them in frame. \n\nUnboxing you’ll find the main Osmo Mobile 6, the magnetic phone clamp, the tripod, charging cable, and a little storage pouch. Getting the Osmo Mobile 6 setup is very simple. Download the DJI MIMO App and it will pair via Bluetooth to your phone and walk you through tutorials on how to operate the different features and modes of the device. While you can utilize the gimbal without connecting to the DJI MIMO App, you do lose some functions like ActiveTrak, switching between cameras, switching shooting modes (photo/video), using the focus or zoom wheel, or using the record button. The functions of the gimbal continue to work, but obviously any feature that relies on communication to your phone becomes very limited. \n\nOverall, the DJI Osmo Mobile 6 has a ton of features to allow flexibility and get you professional looking stabilized footage. With ActiveTrak, not only can you make sure your subject stays perfectly centered in frame, you can also use the included stand and have the gimbal follow you around even if you’re shooting something by yourself. This is a huge advantage if you’re a content creator on the go and use your phone a lot to shoot footage. The built-in tripod mount is also a huge advantage allowing the ultimate flexibility for whatever mount you need to connect the Osmo to. On top of all of those features, the gimbal will also extend into a selfie-stick. \n\nThe different gimbal modes give you a good amount of flexibility on which axis you want to lock down or prioritize. You have Follow mode which will lock your orientation angle but allow you to pan up, down, left, and right. The second mode is Tilk Lock, which will only follow your left or right panning. If you need to pan up or down, you will use the joystick on the Osmo. The 3rd mode is FPV mode which will unlock all 3 axes. Not only will you get panning, the camera will now be allowed to change it’s orientation angle. The final mode is SpinShot allowing you to control the orientation angle using the joy stick. For me, I found the 1st mode the most natural, while modes 2 and 3 allowed some flexibility depending on what shot I was attempting to achieve. \n\nIn conclusion, if you’re needing a compact, feature rich gimbal stabilizer, you don’t need to look further. DJI is a leader in image stabilization from their gimbals to their drones. They make great products and back them with good customer service. I’ve seen some users report issues or limited functionality using Android devices, but I’m confident DJI will be able to fix those bugs moving forward. For the best experience, pairing with an iPhone and the DJI MIMO App will not leave you disappointed.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] As a first time user of a gimbal I was very impressed upon opening the box to find the DJI Osmo Mobile 6 Stabilizer has a high quality look and feel. Inside the box you'll find a brief instruction booklet tucked inside a suede holding pouch, the gimbal, a phone clip magnetic stabilizer unit, a mount grip attachable tripod and a charging cable. You must provide your own charger and I simply used my Apple iPad model which worked perfectly.\n\nI then downloaded the DJI MIMO app and was pleased to see it offers a Beginner's Guide plus Tutorials which are really helpful for a gimbal newbie such as myself. There was a firmware update V01.00.02.40 that went in after I connected my iPhone 12 Pro Max via Bluetooth (which worked flawlessly) and placed in the phone clip stabilizer unit, then attached it to the gimbal. \n\nThere are various function buttons on the gimbal, a battery indicator and also a built in extension rod for taking those low shots or views from above your subject or just because the scene calls for it. This rod pulls out from right above the settings area. The app is set to come on automatically when I attach the phone, a super nice feature. When you want to turn the gimbal off simply remove the phone, flip it down into a folding position and it's off. It's small enough to easily carry and the pouch will keep it safe.\n\nAnother great feature is the Active Track 5.0. I have a 2 year old granddaughter and was so excited to have her over to try this out! Oh my gosh the stabilization went perfectly and the video of her and my daughter is a real keepsake! With the Osmo 6 you have none of the jerky, annoying quirks you get if just holding the phone in your hands, especially action shots. Believe me my granddaughter gave me plenty of running around for action! The videos I took look very professional too!\n\nWe also rent out a B&B property on 15 acres of land and I can't wait to use this for filming out there when we reopen in spring. A virtual tour should look amazing online, especially with all the nature scenery around. This gimbal is perfect for any real estate or scenery usage in my opinion.\n\nI also did straight PHOTO shooting for my online antiques, collectibles and jewelry store. I love how you can zoom in on jewelry marks by using the side wheel (left side). Press once and it controls focus or turn the wheel so it zooms in and out on your object. I found it so much easier to spend time photographing my various items using the Osmo gimbal than doing it freehand with my digital camera. The gimbal is pretty lightweight therefore my arm did not get tired nor did I have to twist and turn my body to get that perfect shot like when using the camera. There is also the tripod which was attached and for some of the shots that was the way to go. Everything turned out wonderful!\n\nThere is a joystick to control the direction and an M button to switch between portrait and landscape modes and also to use the front or back cameras. Other features are available but I suggest you definitely watch videos on YouTube about the DJI Stabilizer for tips, tricks and usage. There are a number out there and all seem very informative. Of course you have the built in app videos which are extremely helpful, especially if you are new to gimbals.\n\nThis is an item I wasn't sure about liking, even though I photograph tons of things. But after using it the last few days I must say now it's indispensable! When I go in to shoot pics it's the first thing I grab in my photography room. From class act videos to photos, the DJI Mobile 6 Stabilizer does it all, works beautifully and is a delight to use! I highly recommend it!",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Epson - RapidReceipt RR-60 Mobile Receipt and Color Document Scanner.\r\n\r\nThe Epson RR-60 scanner is a good portable single sheet document and receipt scanner.\r\nIt scans single sided with adjustable resolution. Easy to use and carry with your laptop for remote use. It can scan 8.5” wide up to 72” long. This makes it very useful for grocery receipts. The included Epson software can be used to scan a double sided document by feeding one side at a time. The software, once a scan is done, allows you to either chose how and where to save your scan, or to add another sheet to this scan. This allows you to scan both sides or multiple pages into one PDF file. The software can also tell the difference between a document and a receipt. When scanning a receipt you can chose what options you would like to be extracted from the scan. This function allows you to organize your receipts.\r\nIt is powered by the supplied micro USB 2.0 cable, no batteries. It also does not have wireless, so direct connection is the only way to use it. I prefer this method, as I have had issues with the wireless ones staying connected during a scan. There is no memory slot, so again direct scan is it. \r\nThe scanner comes with a calibration sheet and a cleaning sheet. Since the scanner does not open to clean the glass, this cleaning sheet will be the only way to remove debris in the scanner. I did not need to use the calibration sheet but in the software there is a calibration function to use. You can also change the shift manually.\r\nThe scanner is also packaged with a serial number for Kofax Power PDF for either Windows or Mac. Just in case you do not have any PDF software. I have a full version of Acrobat Pro so this was not needed, but it is very nice to have a full PDF option included. If you’re looking at this scanner and worried that your PDF software will not do what you need, don’t worry, Kofax Power PDF will do it all.\r\nThe scanner is small, light, and very portable. Easy to include in your laptop bag. And with the USB cable being the only power required, it makes it super convenient.\r\nAll my test scans were straight and worked well. It is also fast enough to not feel like your wasting time. Once set up, the scanner also has a quick scan button. Just load your original and press the button on the scanner, it will open the software for you and scan the document. In my use, pressing the button started the scan immediately and the software opened as the scan was being completed.\r\nThis is by far one of the easiest receipt scanners I’ve used.",

        "comment": "I was initially excited to get this especially seeing that it integrated with Excel and Quicken.  However, then became disappointed.  \n\nFirst after installing the app, had trouble with the scanner connecting to the app.  I would insert a receipt, but then couldn't scan.  After talking with Epson support we did something and the scanner to app connection seemed to work consistently.\n\nBut then came the integration with Excel and Quicken.  I was hoping to scan receipts to a specific Excel file and build the file so that at any point in time I could sum up the individual receipts to get a total.  Cannot do.  Scanning a receipt to Excel would create an Excel spreadsheet for each receipt.  So 100 receipts would create 100 Excel spreadsheets.  Yikes.  \n\nOk, maybe better with Quicken.  Not much.  I did find a workaround to where I could scan a receipt to a specific Quicken file.  But in the end I decided that it was too much work.  My goal was not just to be able to get rid of the paper receipts, but I wanted a management tool so that I could add similar receipts to easily get totals.  \n\nEpson support was good.  The scanner worked well producing clear scans but the software is lacking.  Returned this and still working with paper receipts.  Oh well.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] As someone looking for a reliable, portable scanner, the Epson RR-60 is a perfect fit. It's compact, able to fit in any travel bag, and has the capability to scan standard sized documents. After installing the required software and drivers, this device really becomes plug-and-play. Scanning anything is as easy as pressing a single button, and then verifying the result through the software. It is hard to say when the last time was that I found it this easy to scan documents. Usually you need a combination of finessing with the scanner and then wishing the software saves it in a usable format to see. Here, the software is very intuitive, and auto opens once you start scanning which eliminates the need to remember what software to open. I am also surprised at how well the scanner is able to operate. The automatic feeder is able to detect when it should be done scanning, even after I feed it documents that have been torn or in odd shapes and sizes. The scanning process itself is quick and the images come out clean and crisp. The default setting is at 200dpi, but you can increase it up to 1200 should you choose. Overall, if you're looking for a portable scanner to use without all the fussy software and micromanaging, this may be the product you need.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Epson Rapid Receipt scanner is a very small device designed to do exactly what it's name implies: rapidly scan receipts. The included Epson software was simple to install and detected the scanner right away once I connected the included micro USB cable. Speed wise, this is a simple scanner that handles one page at a time, and as such it scans each page or receipt pretty quickly for a USB 2.0 device. Compared to an older Canon desktop scanner I have used, the Epson RR-60 was quite a bit faster for a single page form. Compared to a newer Epson USB 3.0 'full size' desktop scanner, the RR-60 was slightly slower at loading the pages across the USB interface into my computer, but the overall experience was faster and more convenient due to the size of the device. \r\n\r\nI used the scanner app to email the receipts directly to concur and they worked \"magically.\" I suppose it would be slightly more convenient if it interfaced directly with my Concur account, but as is it's still more convenient than using my phone or a flatbed to scan things.\r\n\r\nIn short, if your primary need for a scanner is to scan receipts or single page forms, this RR-60 takes up very little desk space and is very quick and convenient. A nearly perfect device for what it's designed for.",

        "comment": "The Epson RapidRecepit RR-60 is a handy little scanner.  After the software for the device has been installed, all you have to do to start scanning is insert what you want to scan into the device and press start.  The document scans and the provided software is automatically opened on the computer.  You can scan just one document at a time or hand-feed multiple documents. The scanning is quick and easy. After scanning, you are able to perform several basic operations such as delete, rotate and crop in order to get just the scans you want.\nOnce the scans are complete, there are several options to choose from.  The two options I used were Save to PDF and Manage Invoices/Receipts.  Both worked flawlessly.  I was able to scan individual pages of a document and have them all save into one document. The Manage Invoices/Receipts option is very useful.  I scanned a Save Mart receipt and the software automatically, and correctly, populated several numerical fields.  Other fields, such as Tax category, Classification, and Sub-Classification can be selected and automatically imported into Quickbooks.  In short, I really like this little scanner.

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Epson - RapidReceipt RR-60 Mobile Receipt and Color Document Scanner is a time saver for sure! Super light-weight and portable, it connects via micro-usb to usb-A. I would prefer it was usb-c to usb-c as it is becoming more universal and makes cords inter-changeable, but I can definitely still work with this cord.\r\nDownload the Epson software, hook the scanner up to your computer and you’re ready to go! No external power for this scanner, no on/off button, no WiFi. Just a direct connection - it simply couldn’t be easier! Basically plug and play. Align your document (Max 8-1/2” wide, length up to 75”!) to the left side of the scanner and press the scan button. It is very quick; much quicker than the scanner on my printer. It pops up in your software where you can edit and save in many formats, including editable PDF with the included bonus software. If you’re into scanning receipts (I am!) you can categorize them very easily and the software learns to recognize Logos, names and categories and it then does the categorizing for you. I even scanned 8-1/2 x 11 documents I needed to email and they came out quick and clear. Color is fantastic.\r\nThis is a great little scanner to be able to take wherever needed. Easy as can be - quick, convenient, versatile and it creates beautiful scans. I would highly recommend this to anyone in need of portable scanner!",

        "comment": "I really like this fun little scanner. I do a lot of scanning- bills, receipts, my kids' virtual school work- and I hate having to use a big bulky printer/scanner combo. I don't have time to lay each paper on the scanner and send it to my computer- then edit, save and arrange the files so I can find everything later. With this little scanner, it's no work at all. I keep it with my laptop and it's ready to go anytime. I don't even have to turn it on or off because it senses when I'm trying to scan something and automatically turns off after it's not used for a certain amount of time (you can adjust the time in settings and turn auto-feed on or off).\nThe scanner is simple and easy to use- I actually think it makes the tedious work of scanning fun! Once you have scanned something, the Epson software makes it easy to edit and organize on the computer. I'm still exploring everything I can do with this scanner and the Epson software.\nMy only issue with the scanner is that sometimes it doesn't take my paper/receipt/etc. correctly. It might take a couple of tries or when it goes through, it's crooked or stops halfway through. This doesn't happen every time and it can usually be fixed by using one of the guides included with the scanner. Overall though, I'm very happy with this scanner.\nThis is a review for the RapidReceipt RR-60 Mobile Receipt Scanner that I received free of charge to do a beta test and review.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love this little scanner. I have been wanting one for years to so that I can keep electronic scans of all my receipts instead of buying accordion folders to store everything. Now I have years of receipts at my fingertips without having to physically go through all the papers. The scanner is really easy to use. First you have to plug in the scanner to your computer with the USB cable that is included in the box. Second, you have to download the required drivers for this scanner. The website for this is www.epson.com/support/rr60. It is the Drivers and Utilities combo package application under the Drivers subheading in the middle of the page. For me this was the only drawback, that I had to download a driver to use it. It is not plug and play. Once that is downloaded, open the application, install, and follow the prompts. The rest is easy and very user friendly. Make sure that the light is on which means the scanner is on. When scanning, you have to make sure the paper is all the way to the left edge and facing up. The scanner will grab the document and then you press the start button and you’re done. You cannot use this with a mobile device or use Bluetooth or wifi. The scanner has no battery and relies on power from the computer to operate. It is very lightweight and compact, so it fits in a computer carrying case. Takes up very little room in your work area and you can unplug and put away if you really need to.",

        "comment": "I love this scanner.  I have several bed scanners where you have to put your receipts face down on the glass to scan them.  It is cumbersome, since the scanner is not right next to my keyboard.  With the RR-60, the scanner is sitting just to my left.  I can feed receipts into it without getting out of my chair.  The image is pulled directly into the Invoice/Receipt Manager software where you can edit and classify the receipts.\r\nBecause the scanner is continuous feed, you can feed long receipts (more than 11 inches) into it.  With the bed scanners, you have to either cut up those long receipts or reposition the receipt to get a full image.\r\nIt does have a few little flaws or at least, some items I wish were different.  When feeding in the receipt, you press the button on the top of the scanner.  The feed rollers start up but it does not seem to catch the receipt.  I always have to give the receipt a little push to have the scanner continue to feed.  I thought it might be the way I am positioning the receipt but nothing I do seems to work.\r\nMy only other complaints/recommendations have to do with the software.  I end up doing a lot of repetitive mouse clicks when doing multiple receipts.  For example, when I go to save the image, it defaults to JPEG.  I want to save it as a PDF.  Once I select PDF, the file name format is not what I want.  I have to retype the file name.  (If you select JPEG, you have more flexibility on file name format.)\r\nNone of these little blemishes would prevent me from buying this scanner or recommending it.  I finally able to eliminate the piles of paper on my desk.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Opening the Epson RR60 I found the unit, cleaning and calibration sheets, a USB cable and PDF software. First off, I wish the unit used USBc instead of the old micro USB. I find the old one hard to install and remove. USBc is just so much more convenient as it goes in either way and I’ve never had one so snug that it feels like you may break the port. This unit is like that, very snug and I find myself checking the plug and port many times as I try to connect the two.\r\n\r\nOnce that was completed, installing the software was straight forward. I installed the scanning software and scanned the first color page I could find. It scanned very quickly and looked good. I just had to remember to put my fingers under the feeding edge, so it didn’t get caught on the keys/spacebar. Now for the bummer. I have a wireless printer (not Epson) that I like to use. I tried several times to get it to print, but it just said the printer drivers were bad. Reinstall drivers and retry again. I knew my printer was good, but I used other software to print…just in case. Nope, all good with everything else. So, I do what none of us do. I downloaded the manual and read away. It says this will only print directly to an Epson printer. I have one, but it’s not my main go-to. If I want to use my main printer, I have to scan the document, save it, open it up in a 3rd party PDF app, and print from there. Really! My main gripe as a consumer is all these electronic companies using proprietary software/hardware because they can’t play nice with another manufacturer. It only hurts the end-user. Ugh. If it wasn’t for that one thing, I would give this five stars. It works great except for that. So, three stars it is. It bothers me that much. Maybe enough users will complain, and they can patch it with a firmware update. If it’s hardware, then it is what it is.\r\n\r\nSo, would I recommend it to a friend? Well if my friend is an Epson user, yes by all means. But if they don’t have an Epson printer, then yes but factor in the price of a printer with the scanner purchase.",

Just place a document in the slot, and off you go. \r\nI have used this for receipts, full sized documents and even cards. Great reproduction at great speeds. For the receipts, I keep auto feed on so I can keep the scanner on the ready for easy filing. Scan and toss. Been waiting years for a device this seamless.\r\n\r\nThe software that comes with the unit is a great counterpart. From Epson, you get the Scansmart suite which basically has everything you need to scan, refine, organize, stitch and file your documents within minutes. The second in Nuance Power PDF. I’m am still discovering all this can do, but so far, it is a great alternative to Acrobat without any additional cost. Sort, edit, modify, create searchable, etc. The software alone makes this product top notch. \r\n\r\nHere’s a few cons. Firstly, the scanner cannot accept batches. I have only found it to be single use. For the size, this is not a surprise, just confirming what may be obvious. Second, for many of my full-size documents, even with perfect alignment, the scan may be slightly angles. Not to the point where information is missing, just as if the scan shifted while passing through the reader. I can easily fix it in the software, but I’d rather the scan be aligned the same way I inserted it. I’ll continue to play and haven’t ruled out the idea of user error. Third, I have checked the software over and over, and there is no option for “double sided” scanning. You will have to scan each side and pair together in software. Lastly, the initial set-up was a bit tedious. The scanner wouldn’t connect to the software. It would time out. The software would freeze. After a few restarts and some repeated plug and play, all those issues eventually dissipated, but noting they were there.\r\n\r\nAll and all, I really like the unit and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to find more ways to get organized.",

What really annoys me is that when I am clicking and dragging an email into a folder in outlook…without fail once or twice a week it will think I let go of the button and drop the email in a completely random folder in am hovering over and scrolling through. Then I have to try to figure out which folder it dropped it into and move it again. I use my Microsoft Arc mouse almost exclusively now and this one doesn’t get turned on that often.

        "comment": "I enjoy this scanner a lot. Before I was super unorganized, had important documents thrown everywhere and in all types of random drives ( I know, I know). Because it was so small I was expecting it to be difficult and tiresome to use, however this thing is better than a lot of the larger size scanners. Wifi works great and never need to keep reconnecting /disconnecting. Anything you scan can be uploaded right to quickbooks,excel, which saves time\n\nEveryone at my job now wants their own because they're tired of crappy office machines.\nThe only draw backs is that some of my receipts/papers kept getting jammed (this might be human error). I noticed that after doing a large number of papers , thats when it was doing it. You may have to give it a bit of a rest in between large uses. Lastly this is super important please write down your serial number and keep it safe in case it’s needed in the future because it can not be replaced !This is a review for the RapidReceipt RR-60 Mobile Receipt Scanner that I received free of charge to do a beta test and review",

        "comment": "As long as you have a regular USB connection the RR-60 Mobile Scanner is your go-to for quick scanning. Whether it's receipts that you've collected or an important document, the RR-60 from Epson is sure to help you get the job done quickly. It's self powered through the USB connection which works with either Windows or Mac. This particular unit does NOT offer any wireless options.\n\nI was impressed at the speed at which the scanner is able to scan documents. Most units are slow at this task but the RR-60 speeds right along to ensure that you spend less time scanning and more time doing what you need to do. Image quality is top-notch compared to other scanners out on the market. The RR-60 is perfect if you don't need any wireless options. It's light and small enough to pack in a back for business or personal trips and looks nice enough to post up on your desk. It's a very nice product and I can't wait to get many years of enjoyment out of the product.\nThis is a review for the RapidReceipt RR-60 Mobile Receipt Scanner that I received free of charge to do a beta test and review.",

It is extremely light and easy to travel with...I am in public safety and am constantly needing to be near a computer but also in the field at the same time...this thing solved that for me! I can now just scan documents right to my phone or to the cloud and keep it moving! \n   The setup was extremely easy.... pretty much plug and play..only needed to download a couple things from the links listed in the instruction manual....simple and was working within 5 minutes from first opening the box! The scan quality has been decent enough so far...it's not high def quality but way better than I even expected from a portable scanner. \n  Only cons I have discovered so far is the scanner is so light that it feels really cheap....I don't have any doubt that if I were to accidentally drop it or even just have it in a backpack without a protective case....this thing would crush and break VERY easily. But I somewhat expected that in a portable scanner.\n This is a review for the RapidReceipt RR-60 Mobile Receipt Scanner that I received free of charge to do a beta test and review!",

You know it’s always the important ones that fade so fast and become unreadable! I’ve scanned important documents like bank statements and health records. I’ve even scanned my daughter’s social security card just in case it is ever misplaced. Because of this little device, I hardly need to keep any hard copies of anything anymore! I’ve been able to eliminate multiple filing cabinets.\r\n\r\nThe small size of this product makes it very portable. It weighs under a pound making it very convenient to bring around the house when I have a new thing to scan. The scanner is also lightning fast - it scans 10 pages per minute. It works flawlessly with my Mac and my PC. I used the included software - Kofax Power PDF for my PC and PDF Converter for Mac - to make my documents editable and searchable. This is a huge plus! I can now search all of my documents on my computer instead of thumbing through thousands of pages of documents in my filing cabinets.\r\n\r\nOverall, I love this scanner! Epson is my trusted brand and go to scanner.",

        "comment": "I was initially a little hesitant about this scanner due to its portable size. However, I was happily surprised to see that my expectations were exceeded. The quality of the scans is really great for something this small. Plus, being able to wirelessly scan receipts is a huge plus. I don't know of any other scanners this small that can do that. \n\nDespite the instructions not explicitly saying that they're for this model of the scanner, setting up the scanner was also fairly easy because the instructions are pretty detailed.  The included instructions link you to the download page on Epson's website. From there it was just installing one program. Took about 5 minutes in total. Once the software is installed you're prompted to calibrate the scanner. This was done with the included calibration sheet (much like how you calibrate a printer). Again, very straight forward and only took a few minutes. \n\nOne of the features I really like is that the PDFs the scanner creates are OCR enabled (i.e., the computer picks up the text and is searchable). This is a huge time saver for me as it'll allow me to search through my receipts by date, location, etc. \n\nWhile being \"green\" isn't important to everyone, I really appreciated Epson going the extra mile and making this out of recycled plastics.

        "comment": "This is a very capable little scanner, so I would like to start with that. Between the size and features it is a nice quality product, however, I have some gripes that stop me from giving it five stars. \n\nFirst is the difference in cost between this model and the wireless one (RR-70W) is not justified in todays day and age with wireless chips being as cheap as they are and there being such a limited market for a USB *ONLY* version of this consumer product. The second is the macOS software requiring some configuring to scan a receipt instead of just working right out of the box. The setting I am referring to is the \"Document Size\", and the \"Auto\" size does not work for receipts past a certain length and required to be set to \"Auto Long\". Once that was cleared up however, the hardware works like a charm for scanning to a document. The software for interpreting the receipts is really not up to my standard and was not very accurate despite much trial and mostly error. \n\nBesides the interpretation part of the software, the scanner produces a nice clear image quickly and easily via the included USB-A to Micro-USB cable. After changing the aforementioned \"Document Size\" setting it had no problem scanning a long Kroger grocery receipt, which gives it a huge advantage over most flat-top scanners with their limited scan length. For those with a limited desk area who are handling multiple odd-length documents often, this is an ideal choice (however I personally would opt for the wireless option to reduce clutter even further). I also do like the look of this scanner for what its worth. This is a review for the RapidReceipt RR-60 Mobile Receipt Scanner that I received free of charge to do a beta test and review.",

It is fast, easy to use, perfect for travel quick & easy set up, I went to epsom.com for set up rather than use the disk it came with, I feel like it was faster & r. This has made my life so much easier no more wallet, or box full of receipts, documents & even business cards, & another favorite is that it scans in color also! I started scanning ever couple days it’s taken literally 2 mins to scan & organize! I recommend this to any person who is a mess with papers it’s a life saver",

        "comment": "Easy to use and set up. My experience is only with USB data, although wi-fi is also supposed to be available. The scanner seems to work quite well for single sheet and receipt scanning. I haven't tried a photo. The instructions call for a special sheet protector when scanning damaged paper, but said protector was not available via the link given. Perhaps the sheet for another model works, but I could find none that listed this model. The instructions also advise using the original packing material when traveling, which doubles or triples its volume. This perhaps indicates that it isn't rugged enough for frequent travel, a shame because it is also very compact.  A final note, there is no on-off switch, so the scanner must be unplugged from its USB port to turn off the power.",

I have been on the fence about it for quite some time- but I finally got one and I am so happy that I did! I have had scanners in the past but nothing like this! It is very compact and requires minimal space to set up. It is very nicely designed and has helped me stay significantly more organized. It's more than just reciepts- you can scan other documents, buisness cards and more. I no longer have to search through piles of paper reciepts to find what I am looking for, they are all nicely filed away and labeled. It saves me time, hassle, space, and a lot of frustration. I am buying another one for the family buisness! It would make a great gift, too! I highly recommend picking one up and trying it out, you will wonder why you haven't gotten one sooner.",

        "comment": "My new Epson RapidReceipt 60 scanner is convenient.  I am replacing a printer/scanner combo.  With my printer/scanner combo, it would only scan one page at a time and only scan to a jpeg (photo) format.  I would have to then save to pdf file and then have lots of separate pdf for one document.  Not, with the RR-60!  \n     I am not tech savvy and need step by step directions.  This scanner is almost plug and play.  There are directions and on the website better directions with cartoon graphics.  You have to plug the scanner into your computer to charge it.  And to be honest, I think that is they only way to turn it on.  I can not find how to turn it on/off.  I thought I read it was supposed to be wireless, but I do not see how to do that.  The instructions show the other model RR-70W being able to scan to a cell phone, so maybe it is that model that is wireless.  \n     You can only scan one sheet of paper at a time, and it is one sided only (not duplex scanning).  But that is ok.  The scanner is fast.  And you can rearrange your scans so if you scan pages 1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 6 in that order, you can later numerically order the scans to be in order:  That screen allows you to crop, delete, rotate, and organize the scans in any order you want; there is also a zoom feature so you can see the scan’s detail as well.  \n     You can save in pdf, word, and even in powerpoint format.  The negative is once it saves, it becomes a blurry/fuzzy pdf.  It is no longer clear and crisp.  \n     You can also scan and organize your receipts.  I started scanning my receipts.  The scanning of a 8X10 document is easier than receipts, you will have to make sure you are giving it a tiny push to get the receipt to be sucked in.  There is a “review invoices/receipts” feature that you can organize into categories and even upload it to certain tax preparation programs.  At this time, you can scan to quicken and turbo tax.  Although I employ a different tax preparation software, I find the receipt scanning very convenient; it still organizes it for me compared to my shoebox of receipts I have now.  \n     You can also scan photos too!  This so much more convenient than the printer/scanner combo I already have and the product is a little bit better than taking a photo with your cell phone too.

        "comment": "My new Epson RapidReceipt 60 scanner is convenient.  I am replacing a printer/scanner combo.  With my printer/scanner combo, it would only scan one page at a time and only scan to a jpeg (photo) format.  I would have to then save to pdf file and then have lots of separate pdf for one document.  Not, with the RR-60!  \r\n     I am not tech savvy and need step by step directions.  This scanner is almost plug and play.  There are directions and on the website better directions with cartoon graphics.  You have to plug the scanner into your computer to charge it.  And to be honest, I think that is they only way to turn it on.  I can not find how to turn it on/off.  I thought I read it was supposed to be wireless, but I do not see how to do that.  The instructions show the other model RR-70W being able to scan to a cell phone, so maybe it is that model that is wireless.  \r\n     You can only scan one sheet of paper at a time, and it is one sided only (not duplex scanning).  But that is ok.  The scanner is fast.  And you can rearrange your scans so if you scan pages 1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 6 in that order, you can later numerically order the scans to be in order:  That screen allows you to crop, delete, rotate, and organize the scans in any order you want; there is also a zoom feature so you can see the scan’s detail as well.  \r\n     You can save in pdf, word, and even in powerpoint format.  The negative is once it saves, it becomes a blurry/fuzzy pdf.  It is no longer clear and crisp.  \r\n     You can also scan and organize your receipts.  I started scanning my receipts.  The scanning of a 8X10 document is easier than receipts, you will have to make sure you are giving it a tiny push to get the receipt to be sucked in.

My scan time has also reduced with this receipt scanner. Originally it used to take about 4-5 hours to size, reorder and scan all my receipts.

I use it primarily for the document scanning since I work from home! It connects to your PC via USB connection. \r\nBefore you can use it you’ll need to download Epson SmartScan software. Just Google the model number of the scanner and you’ll find the Epson support page to install the driver and scanner software. \r\nIncluded in the packaging is a license to the Nuance Power PDF software which allows one to edit PDFs, add text, sign documents via e-signature, and more! This is supplemental software that is great if you need to do additional formatting to your scanned PDFs or PDFs downloaded online. \r\nOverall I’m satisfied with the Epson RR-60 and will use it often!\r\nNote: This is a review for the RapidReceipt RR-60 Mobile Receipt Scanner that I received free of charge to do a beta test and review.",

It does color and black and white and everything up to a letter-sized piece of paper. Once it scans the document, it asks how and where you want to save it and that's it. \r\n\r\nIt's small enough to fit in a backpack or briefcase, so you can take it with you as needed.",

I really love how easy this mini scanner was to set up and use. I dont have a disc reader on my computer but was able to download the drivers fromt he epson website. I just started my business last year once i started making masks to sell to those who needed them while we had a shortage of PPE. I used my knowledge of sewing and purchased a machine from walmart and got to work sewing masks. I ended up helping others buy fbric from my local quilt shop who had an abundance when there was the fabric shortage that did happen last year. I had so much go thourgh my accounts i was advised to just open my own shop so i did. I have a lot of reciepts from buying fabric whihc i need keep for records in case im ever audited. I have beens tressing on how i was going to keep track of them all when i was given the chance to test and review it. It couldnt have come at a more needed time. I am so happy with this mini scanner, it really is super easy to use. It took me a bit to realize that theres no power switch on this model so i wasnt sure if it was set to go or not but decided to put a reciept in and it fed through with ease. I defietly think everyone should own one of these business or not, its worth the money. After years of crappy Hp printers i recently switched to epsons and boy have I been missing out, you could say these products made me a EPSON user for life.",

        "comment": "Don't know how I survived all this time without The Epson RapidReceipt RR-60 Mobile Receipt and Color Document Scanner. It is so handy and convenient that I take it everywhere my laptop bag goes. It's so small and lightweight, I don't even feel any additional weight to the bag.\r\nThe setup to the Epson  RapidReceipt RR-60 Scanner was pretty easy with the little quick set up tip sheet. It was set up and ready to use in minutes. Since I'm remodeling, I scanned those receipts into the program and now I can keep track of what is being spent. It's also great to scan business cards in to. Makes it easier to reference numbers that I need to call. The Epson - RapidReceipt RR-60 Mobile Receipt  Document Scanner is truly a lifesaver for me.\r\n “This is a review for the RapidReceipt RR-60 Mobile Receipt Scanner that I received free of charge to do a beta test and review.”",

Either just scan the document or receipt as a file/jpeg, or use the smart scan software for receipts or invoices. The software is great, it allows you to scan the receipts then extracts all the information like vendor, amount, tax, tip, etc which then will export the information into quick books, turbo tax, or any software your business uses. I am part of a startup company where we receive hundreds of weeks of receipts and invoices, this little scanner and software allows us to take it with us anywhere if we need to.

I can toss it in my backpack when I go to my rental property out of state to do maintenance work and any receipt I can just go ahead and scan right in or save them up and scan them in when I get home.  I actually just used it to scan all of my tax docs for this year so I could upload them to turbo tax.  Epson has always been a brand name that I could stand behind.  I have had various Epson printers over the years because they always print the best photos.  I am so happy to add this little scanner to my office.  It was super simple to setup and start scanning.  I have a scanning app on my phone but I will use this any day over an app.  Love Love Love.  Oh and if remote learning continues into the next school year my kids will be using this to submit hand written homework as well.",

        "comment": "As long as you have a regular USB connection the RR-60 Mobile Scanner is your go-to for quick scanning.  Whether it's receipts that you've collected or an important document, the RR-60 from Epson is sure to help you get the job done quickly.  It's self powered through the USB connection which works with either Windows or Mac.  This particular unit does NOT offer any wireless options.\r\n\r\nI was impressed at the speed at which the scanner is able to scan documents.  Most units are slow at this task but the RR-60 speeds right along to ensure that you spend less time scanning and more time doing what you need to do.  Image quality is top-notch compared to other scanners out on the market.  The RR-60 is perfect if you don't need any wireless options.  It's light and small enough to pack in a back for business or personal trips and looks nice enough to post up on your desk.  It's a very nice product and I can't wait to get many years of enjoyment out of the product.",

After downloading the software onto my laptop I was easily able to update the scanner to the latest version of firmware without any issue. \r\n\r\nI was easily able to scan receipts of varying sizes and full page color documents with a simple touch of the button on the scanner. You can scan your documents directly to a cloud service of your choice or to a editable pdf using Kofax power PDF which is included. You can also scan multiple pages into 1 pdf as well as double side documents via settings in the software. Data from your receipts or invoices can be easily exported to third party software such as quicken QuickBooks or TurboTax. \r\n\r\nIf you are looking for a lightweight portable easy to use scanner then you can't go wrong with the Epson RR-60",

It sometimes needs help feeding long receipts through or they will jam, but nothing a little guiding with your hand can't help. I love the Epson ScanSmart Software. It allows you to sequentially scan multiple scans, review them, and then export them or download them separately or all at once to your given folder or business management software like QuickBooks. When scanned to the invoice/receipt manager software from Epson, it can actually auto detect vendors like USPS for easier classification and tax management. It is only about 11 inches long and is super light, taking up hardly any footprint at all on your desk or table. Just note that this RR-60 is the wired version, the RR-70 is what you want for wireless scans. Thanks for reading, I definitely would get this if this is the kind of scanner you are looking for!",

Connect USB to computer, tug the document in the corner of scanner, press the button, once scan is complete (scans quickly) , press Next button in screen, and choose where to save image . That’s it ! I asked my husband’s granddaughter to help me scan receipts . She is 5. ☺️",

        "comment": "The Epson RR-60 is a fast and light weight scanner that plugs into your PC via USB connection.  It’s been super helpful for me since I’m working more from home. I’m able to scan documents easily to the Epson SmartScan software. \n\nYou’ll need to download the Epson SmartScan software via Epson’s website. A quick Google search of “Epson RR-60 drivers” will take you to the support page to download the drivers and SmartScan software. It’s very easy to install on your PC. Just make sure it’s plugged in during install so it’ll connect. \n\nIncluded also is a license to Nuance PowerPDF software. It allows you to edit PDFs, e-signature, create forms, add text, and much more. It’s a great supplemental software to have if you desire to do more with your documents!\n\nOverall I am satisfied with the Epson RR-60 and would recommend to anyone looking for something portable and easy to use!",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Epson rapid receipt scanner is easy to use and pretty much just plug and play. Windows OS recognizes the hardware with no issues. Even though it can be used once it is connected, I recommend downloading the software from the manufacturer for better performance. The scanner itself is very light and in a compact format perfect for on the go productivity. \r\n\r\nWhen ready to use all you have to do is press the scan button on the device and it will automatically lunch the scanner software. Lightly insert the receipt, document or business card in the feeder and the scanner will do it's magic. The dedicated software which you have to download from the Epson website is also easy to use. \r\n\r\nThe software has a lot of scanning options including PDF and a dedicated receipt and invoice format. For anyone keeping track of their financials I see the receipt and invoice option beneficial. That option will automatically extract important information such as payment option, tax, total, date etcetera and then it can be exported to various formats including excel, quickbooks, and turbotax. \r\n\r\nIf you work on the go and keep track of your financials this scanner will do the job just right efficiently and quietly. This device does not have a built in battery or wireless connectivity, it has to be connected via USB to be used. In the box you get the scanner, micro USB cable and manuals.",

Simple to install and immediately allows me to access my files, receipts, and most recently my tax returns.

It is extremely light and easy to travel with...I am in public safety and am constantly needing to be near a computer but also in the field at the same time...this thing solved that for me! I can now just scan documents right to my phone or to the cloud and keep it moving! The setup was extremely easy.... pretty much plug and play..only needed to download a couple things from the links listed in the instruction manual....simple and was working within 5 minutes from first opening the box! The scan quality has been decent enough so far...it's not high def quality but way better than I even expected from a portable scanner. Only cons I have discovered so far is the scanner is so light that it feels really cheap....I don't have any doubt that if I were to accidentally drop it or even just have it in a backpack without a protective case....this thing would crush and break VERY easily. But I somewhat expected that in a portable scanner. This is a review for the RapidReceipt RR-60 Mobile Receipt Scanner that I received free of charge to do a beta test and review!",

        "comment": "The Epson Rapid Receipt RR-60 is an exceptionally good receipt and document scanner.  It is a small, fast, lightweight, and portable scanner designed for managing receipts/invoices.  It can scan receipts, business cards, and PDF documents fast and effortlessly.  Setup and installation were completed within minutes.  I just attached the USB cable to scanner and my Surface Pro and downloaded the necessary software and drivers from the Epson website.  The instructions were quite simple to follow.  I am able scan documents and categorize them into applicable folders in a specified location.  I have saved in Google drive, my documents’ folder on my computer and even emailed a few documents using the software.  Scanned items can be saved or exported.  This scanner has made storing my personal documents especially old tax return information a breeze.  Gone are days of storing piles of receipts and documents.  It is a very efficient scanner, and I am very pleased with its capabilities.  So far, I have no complaints.  I would really recommend it for anyone needing to organize paperwork whether personal or business.

I upload a lot of receipts and documents daily and would have to use my bulky printer to scan then upload into my email and send to appropriate receiver. Lots of times they were everywhere in my email, leaving me spending unnecessary times locating them. This little handy scanner does it all in a matter of seconds and neatly files them all in one place. I’m not sure how I’ve survived all this time without this scanner. I’m so thankful to of had the opportunity to receive this scanner to test. “This is a review for the RapidReceipt RR-60 Mobile Receipt Scanner that I received free of charge to do a beta test and review.”",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Set up is simple. Plug in the USB cord to the RR-60 then your PC or MAC. I went to the website and downloaded the driver software. After a quick installation, I just place the document to be scanned into the front of the scanner and push the start button. The document is scanned.\r\n\r\nWhat's nice is the scanner is thin and lightweight. Easy to carry along for scanning on the go. Perfect for receipts. EPSON makes the scanner solid and easy to use.",

        "comment": "This Epson Rapid Receipt RR-60 portable wireless scanner is one of the easiest scanners I have ever used. Simple to install and immediately allows me to access my files, receipts, and most recently my tax returns. Scanning my files and being able to import them directly to my tax program was as simple as a push of a button.\r\n\r\nI also use it to scan my receipts from retail stores to keep track of extended in-store warranties or product replacements. Great little scanner that basically helps simplify my life. I'm completely satisfied with the results of using this product.

I have already scanned documents onto my computer using this. It is very easy to use. You do need to download the software to use it, but once you do that you are ready to go. Put your documents right in the scanner and push scan. Very simple to use. I also like that it comes with a software that can easily access where you do your taxes and upload documents to your tax software, that is so cool. It's nicely made, and it is not big, doesn't take up alot of space. Even scans in color, perfect for your everyday scanning! I would definitely recommend this thing is very perfect and useful! .",

It is capable of quickly scanning documents, and either creating searchable PDFs, or even extracting the important data from receipts for bookkeeping.\r\n\r\nI wish the device had battery power and internal memory, because it is portable, but it is not standalone. It must be plugged in to a computer via USB to get power or to be able to scan.\r\n\r\nThat said, I love this scanner. It is small enough to fit in my computer bag, easy to transport, even in to an office, and doesn't take up much space on a desk.",

Super small and light as well taking up hardly any table space. Comparable to the size of a 3 ring hole punch. This thing devours paperwork with ease and quickness eliminating all of the paper trail or shoe boxes of receipts as my nanny used to keep. \r\n\r\nIt's a simple setup plug into your pc using the provided usb to update the current firmware and get ya started. Everything is pretty self explanatory and easy to use. Would definitely recommend to others",

        "comment": "I have to start by saying, I absolutely love the RapidReceipt RR-60! It’s so sleek and small that it takes no room at all on my desk. I upload a lot of receipts and documents daily and would have to use my bulky printer to scan then upload into my email and send to appropriate receiver. Lots of times they were everywhere in my email, leaving me spending unnecessary times locating them. This little handy scanner does it all in a matter of seconds and neatly files them all in one place. I’m not sure how I’ve survived all this time without this scanner. I’m so thankful to of had the opportunity to receive this scanner to test. “This is a review for the RapidReceipt RR-60 Mobile Receipt Scanner that I received free of charge to do a beta test and review.”",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I can't say enough wonderful things about the DJI Osmo Mobile 6 stabilizer. All that is required is to download the app onto your phone and you're ready to start creating videos. \n\nLet's discuss the features. The first feature of course is the stabilizing feature. It does a great job at keeping the camera steady as I even had my daughter hold the camera and check out how well it stabilized. Okay, that's just one little feature. Another great feature is with the app open, you can set the stabilizer up to actively track someone or something. I first tried the feature on a cat (The cat wasn't amused), then I tried the feature on myself just walking around the house, and the stabilizer tracked perfectly (It was a little slow but very smooth). The app itself has so many different features that I can't even list them all, as I'm continuously learning about them as I use the stabilizer. Another great thing about the stabilizer and the app is that as you access new features it gives you simple step-by-step tutorials to follow, which makes learning how to use the stabilizer a breeze. \n\nOverall, I'm super impressed with it, from the active track to the features on the app itself. This is a great product!",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] While great for TikTok videos & vertical filming, the horizontal vlogging while tilted is bad. Tilt motion is limited making walking vlogs with the front facing camera a challenge. Also you can only selfie film yourself using the front facing camera. The camera would often lose track of me and I constantly had to readjust. It doesn’t have the full range of motion which I need for outdoor filming. Vertical movements from the top to bottom shows the flaw in the design. The quick setup is great. It’s very light but sturdy. I like the built in selfie stick, and the software is pretty good. You really need to think ahead about what type of filming you’ll do as this unit has a lot of great features. The issue is that it doesn’t meet my needs and after getting a gimbal where I can vlog myself using the rear facing camera I realize that this unit is not for me. It’s not a bad product, but you really need to know what your needs are before buying a gimbal to film. In certain situations this product is perfect. It really is a well made good product depending on what you need to accomplish with your filming.",

I mostly focused on still images mainly because handheld video is never easy to get right.  \n\nSo this is the first gimbal I have ever used and I must say I am very impressed.  Video while moving is super steady and the ability to track targets is incredibly useful.  Still coming up with different ways to use this feature as it opens up so many possibilities.\n\nIn the box you get the gimbal, phone clip and tripod and charging cable\n\nOut of the box, set up is easy and intuitive - scan a QR code and download an app, pair the gimbal with Bluetooth.  The app offers lots of training for newbies like myself via tutorial videos.  And you pick up a lot just by experimenting with the different features.  \n\nPhysical controls are in easy to use places, and the wheel for zoom and button for swapping between stills and video are very useful.  The gimbal is well balanced and ergonomically designed.\n\nThis is an easy device to recommend to anyone wanting to take their cell phone videos to the next level.",

        "comment": "Using it with my iPhone 12 Pro and the motor is very weak. I need to be careful on how I  maneuver my movement otherwise the motor will give out and I have to reset the position. It’s works fine when holding it upright but other certain basic movement  it will throw the motor out of wack. The price for this product should be below $100. I bought it for the DJI brand.",

My phone also was not stabilized like all the YouTube videos.\n\nI wish I did not get this item.",

The new jog wheel on the left lets you really zoom in and out very smooth but also give you the opportunity to control your focus. I like that the little screen on this model which tells you which shooting on.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Yes. I'm an Android enthusiast. My Samsung S22 Ultra is a great phone, but I understand Apple gets a lot of the third party compatibility. Maybe that's due to the fragmentation of Android. Who knows? But I really don't appreciate companies that claim to be compatible with Android who are not truly compatible. This DJI Osmo Mobile 6 is a perfect example of that. Apple has an official app you can find in their app store, but Android is left with an APK (that my anti-virus program warned me about downloading) that needs to be side loaded. There needs to be more effort in labeling this on the box and in the product description. However, it still works for stabilizing, just don't think you'll be able to take advantage of all the zoom features and controlling options the stabilizer has. Luckily, I am mainly using it for family memories, so my Scorsese skills in film making will not need a lot of these controls. But I'd love for it to be available if the product is priced the same no matter if it all works or not. It'd be nice to have an Android edition, that may lack all features, but would be cheaper. The build quality is excellent though. Not too heavy, but hefty enough to feel the quality materials used. All in all, I'm glad I own it because as a stabilizer it works well. I just wish it was truly compatible with Android officially.",

        "comment": "This is a solid and portable gimble, from its hardware to its mobile app! It has a slight learning curve but is very easy to grasp. \n\nYou will have a wide range of stable and directional control for your videos/photos, and the extender arm and the tripod attachment make it a bonus for hitting those angles or those POV and selfie shots. \n\nI am also impressed with the thumb access to all of those buttons to trigger all of your iPhone's video and photo features without using the touchscreen. It is a very efficient and well-thought-out user experience. It would also be great if the trigger finger button could be customized as the video record or photo snapshot button.\n\nMy only gripe is the MagSafe clamp for iPhones using a protective case, as it could interfere with your buttons and continuously trigger them. It takes a little finesse, and it depends on your protective case, but you might be able to avoid it. Centering the MagSafe clamp is not difficult once you have done it a few times.\n\nIn some cases, you might need to offset the positioning of the clamp to avoid button triggering, which could also affect the gimble's auto-balancing feature in landscape mode. The gimble may also use more battery life to maintain its balance during landscape mode.\n\nHowever, if you still have button/balancing issues with the DJI MagSafe clamp, I came across a perfect adapter mount if you Google \"DJI magnetic ring holder phone clamp mount.\" It works perfectly with Magsafe iPhone cases and with the DJI Osmo 6 gimble!",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The DJI Osmo Mobile 6 Stabilizer is one of the coolest products I’ve used in some time. Right out of the set up is super easy, scan the QR code to take you to the app store and download the DJI Mimo App and pair it via Bluetooth. Once in the app there are multiple tutorial videos that help you get familiar with the DJI Osmo Mobile 6, which is a nice feature to have so you're not having to Google or go on Youtube to learn how to properly use this device.  The metal mounting clip is one of the better mounts I have come across, in that it stretches wide enough to grasp around my Iphone 14 Pro Max with a case on, I was for sure thinking that my case was going to be too bulky for it but it was able to. The Mimo software is great in that it basically mimics my iPhone’s camera interface but with some more options on the screen depending on which setting you are in, such as in photo mode where there is a shutter timer where you can pick from 3 seconds, 5 seconds and 7 seconds. In the Video mode it allows you to pick the resolution (720P,1080P or 4K) and what frame rate you would like to shoot in, which is super nice being able to pick that right from the camera interface and not having to dive into the setting to find it. Then the most outstanding feature of the DJI Osmo Mobile 6 has to be the head tracking feature in that when shooting video, a green box shows up and the arm will literally move and follow your head as you move which is perfect for filming things such as content or family videos. The buttons on the DJI Osmo Mobile 6 are very intuitive in that you get a Zoom knob, a record button, a focus stick that allows you to move the arm like you would with the right stick on a game controller, and A landscape to vertical button. There is a trigger button on the back of the handle that is not as intuitive and I highly recommend watching all the tutorial videos to learn all of its little tricks. In summary I think this is one of the best filming accessories you can buy to truly get the best photos and videos on your cell phone.",

If you have the OM5 model and you don't think the zoom button is something useful for you, than no need for upgrades. Otherwise, if you don't have phone stabilizer, definitely buy! Very noob friendly and useful for great content!",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] As a mobile platform gimble, this phone option is amazing.  From the various options provided within the initial presets to aide in learning how to setup, use, and take the best images and videos.  Mobile photo and videos have taken over normal photography options with what’s being made avail today.  Find my normal camera spends more time in it’s carrying bag these days when want that quick shot, my mobile is my go to.  It does take a little bit to set this up for first use with a firmware update during the initial setup.  Once past this and going through the various training videos provided within the app, some calibration to support the phone better (Samsung and Pixel Pro), thigs got only better.  This is very responsive in hold to movement for vertical and horizontal filming.  For first timer’s, this may seem a little overwhelming going through the initial steps depending on how familiar you are with what you’re presented.  For those with experience and/or knowledge, should walk through fairly easily from adding the app to your mobile device, establishing the Bluetooth connection, and getting to the operational play state.  Setup and play time took appox. 30 minutes due avid background with DJI product, other gimbals, and photography/video.  Part the time included playing around with all of the options presented to annoying some of my family while out and about taking footage of high-rise buildings.  Someone special had their own paparazzi for a little bit.\n\nThe gimble itself looks and feels very sturdy, easily unlocked and opened for attachment of your mobile device.  The magnet system on this and phone clamp attaches to the phone securely.  Perhaps one of the most notable changes added are the zoom and focus options as they aide you in getting your best shots.  It does telescope out to aide in those 360 degree and weird position footages where you need the extra length to capture appropriately.  I would highly recommend this for any new or current photographer looking for something to use with their mobile device.\n\nTo note, had to add one of my own wrist straps and capture cord to hand form my neck in the event I should drop the unit as nothing like this was provided in the box; a foul perhaps with the cost tied to this.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I enjoy creating digital content videos, photos, and reels in my spare time and was fortunate to find the new DJI Osmo Mobile 6 stabilizer. I was using an android and an iPhone to create the content which was fun to shoot on vacations and occasionally use a selfie stick with a remote control. I was so happy when I found the new DJI Osmo 6 Stabilizer which immediately made me realize why the price was set above what I expected for my first experience with the brand. I started with the unboxing of the product and noticed immediately that the luxurious quality of the device was far greater than I ever expected. I saw the various sturdy buttons along with the digital display that provides the status of the device and the type of recording you are set to start. Even the tripod stand was a higher quality of plastic and sturdier than my prior product. \n I was impressed with how strong the magnet was to firmly hold my brand-new iPhone 14 Pro Max which is not a light phone. When I hit the commands to flip my phone from portrait to landscape mode, I was thrilled to see it so quick and effortlessly. I downloaded the DJI application for my smartphones which I saw in the instructions and on the box. I found the setup videos and multiple device instruction videos to be extremely helpful for a newbie to the brand.\nI was able to pair it immediately via Bluetooth with my iPhone and it immediately started the setup process on the DJI Osmo gimble and in the application on my phone. I was like a kid having fun when I tried the various activities they take you through from shooting videos, to choosing a smaller area to target for video and then moved into the photo mode. After completing each task, it would flash a congratulatory type of message to let you know you were doing everything correctly. I was relieved that with so many features available on the device that the simple instructions took away the anxiety of having to learn how to make another accessory compatible with the smartphone I was using. I was able to use the device a couple of days before writing this review, so I found the best aspects of the smooth operating system that was satisfying for taking a chance on this new brand. I have already produced new media content and loved that the video stabilization feature proved to be great at keeping the final video from looking too shaky. I am confident that the Osmo Mobile 6 Stabilizer will be my go-to accessory when I create my special projects and for even fun family events to get everyone in the picture or produce even better videos \nI would highly recommend this product to my friends and family who have smartphones that are compatible with the devices listed on the company’s app and website. I look forward to many adventures with the brand and using their products on my international trips along with content created at home regularly.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Take your videos and even pictures to the next level.  This thing is awesome!  In the box you will find the device, stand, carrying case, and magnet for your phone.  I used this with an iPhone 4 pro and setup was a breeze.  During the app setup there is a quick tutorial that will help you understand how each button functions.  There are many short cuts like pushing certain buttons twice to change from wide or portrait mode.  It will take some time to learn the short cuts and become acclimated with it.  The website also offers guides and tutorials as well. \n\nThe motors that they used for the stabilizer are so smooth.  When recording a video you do not see the camera shake or jitter.  When the motors move there is no sound or jumping.  Its very comfortable to hold for long periods of time or you can even use the provided stand.  The overall feel is very premium and of a high quality. \n\nThe app that you download to use the stabilizer is easy to use.  It also offers different photo/video modes along with tips on how to take great videos.  The app quickly connects to the stabilizer via Bluetooth.  There is also no lag from the app to the stabilizer, everything happens quickly.  \n\nI'm a novice photographer, but this thing is so much fun to use and I can see taking it with me on vacation.  My favorite thing to use is the follow/tracking feature.  I was able to hold the stabilizer and it was able to track my dog running around the house.  I was amazed at how easily and quickly it kept on the dog.  This is by far my favorite feature of the stabilizer.  It will make taking videos a lot of fun and easy.\n\nThis is my first stabilizer and overall I love it!  I cannot wait to show it off to people and use it for videos.  The DJI is worth every penny as it is such a premium device.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The DJI Osmo Mobile 6  Gimbal is a very high quality, well designed mobile stabilizer.\n\nBut as an owner of the Google Pixel 6 I have to point out some of the negatives right from the start.\n\nFirst, the DJI MIMO app is not available in the Google Play Store. In order to download the app you must go into settings and allow download and installation of apps from unknown sources. That’s right, you must download an app from a Chinese company directly, without being verified by Google. This of course is accompanied by a warning that downloading this app may cause harm to your device and other apps on your device.  Not very comforting. In addition, not all features work on Android phones. Each phone model is different and therefore this may vary by device.\n\nAlso, I found that my phone was hotter in the Osmo than it is normally when its in camera mode, and the battery drained much quicker.\n\nOne other issue is the magnetic clip holder. It goes on the Pixel phone on top of the volume switch. If placed exactly in the middle of the phone it presses on the down volume switch and turns the volume all the way down.\n\nThe focus scroll wheel is also not functional with my Pixel phone.\n\nThe device itself is very high quality, very ergonomically designed. It is very well balanced in the hand and does not cause hand fatigue. All buttons and switches are placed within easy reach.\n\nDJI has videos in the app to fully explain the operation of each switch.\n\nIn the box you get the magnetic phone clip, the stabilizer unit, an attachable tripod and a charging cable.\n\nAfter you download the app, the Osmo 6 will automatically turn on when you attach the phone and off when the phone is removed.\n\nOne of my favorite features is face lock while in video. Your phone will lock on your face and follow you around. You can place the phone in the Osmo with the tripod, put it on a flat surface and record yourself while moving, and the camera will follow you. A push of a button will automatically switch between portrait and landscape.\n\nImage stabilization is of course a main reason for buying this device and it performs better than any phone by itself.\n\nThere is a scroll wheel for zooming in and out as well as a button for switching between video and photo.\n\nThere are way too many features to mention, however DJI does a great job of explaining the functions in video and with hints that appear on the screen.\n\nI would love to recommend this device, and I would to any iPhone user. But if you are an Android user I would weigh the positives and negatives before purchasing. I don’t know why DJI has put Android users in this situation and I hope that this situation changes sooner rather than later. This could easily be a5 start review if not for the software issues for Android.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Osmo Mobile 6 is a very fun smartphone gimbal stabilizer packed with great features to help you capture smooth, creative footage and fun photos. I like that a lot of what the gimbal has to offer is right at my finger tips. Changing modes, camera orientation, and angles is a click of a button or a push of the joystick away from personal customization. Each mode focuses on customizing which axis has priority over the movement of the camera. More on the modes below.\n\nDJI MIMO APP\nTo get the most out of the DJI Osmo Mobile 6, I suggest downloading the DJI Mimo app which allows you to use all the buttons to their fullest potential. Using the DJI Mimo app will unlock these additional button or handle features:\nSwitch between front and back camera\nSwitch between photo and video mode\nUse the focusing or zoom wheel\nUse the record button\n\nThe features listed above are not available to use with my Google Pixel Camera App. Here are the Osmo Mobile 6 buttons or handle features you can use WITHOUT the Mimo app (say like with your phone’s native camera app, these will just inherently work if the gimbal is on and the phone is mounted properly): \nJoystick\nSwitching between Landscape or Portrait orientation\nChanging Modes\nRe-centering with trigger button\nUsing the trigger to “lock” the view\n\nThe DJI Mimo app is very neat. I really like the subject-follow feature because it essentially allows you to set the camera down and let the app/camera follow your movement even without handling the gimbal itself. This is possible with the included mountable tripod which is an awesome accessory that’s included with this kit. My phone is not compatible with the focusing feature so the wheel on the side only allows me to zoom, not smoothly I might add, but not a dealbreaker.\n\nEXTENDING FEATURE\nThis gimbal also extends so you can get high up drone-like shots or very low shots. It’s like a selfie stick, but better because it’s also a gimbal! The only downside to this is that because of the extendable feature, you have to be careful when taking it to amusement parks as they often don’t allow extendable devices like this one.\n\n4 GIMBAL MODES\nOut of the 4 modes, the one that’s more “general” or easiest to work with is the first one: Follow mode. It’s going to either pan up or down, left or right, depending on which way you move the camera, and it won’t “roll” sideways. \n\nThe second mode: Tilt Lock, will do just that, lock the tilt and allow you to pan left or right with natural hand movement. If you want to change the angle of the tilt in Tilt Lock mode, just use the joystick to bring the camera’s view up or down. \n\nThe third mode: FPV will actually follow any movement on all 3 axes, so you get more dynamic or creative shots with this mode as it will “roll” (turn the camera sideways) as you’re following a subject. \n\nThe fourth mode: SpinShot allows you to naturally “roll” the camera sideways while still facing a subject, as well as lets the joystick rotate the camera as well, whereas in the other modes, the joystick is moving the camera angle up, down, left or right. SpinShot allows the camera to tilt sideways. To get a visual of what this looks like, look straight ahead then lean your head to one side like you’re putting your ear to your shoulder, and keep looking straight. This is the “roll” effect I’m talking about.\n\nOVERALL\nI love playing with this gimbal. I take it to local music shows and plan to take it to a festival to get some smooth footage and fun pictures. It’s great for people who like to film videos whether it’s for an event or an artistic video piece. This gimbal has plenty of modes to work with to get super creative shots or just get nicely stable footage. I’ve only had to charge it once so far and I’ve used it a few times. There’s a nice indicator screen that shows you modes, battery level, and will let you know with a red light above the battery indicator if the magnet is not secured properly. I can definitely recommend this gimbal to anyone who likes video tech or looking to gift it.",

The DJI MIMO app connects via bluetooth and takes advantage of your camera with the auto track and the editing options. \nThe gimbal itself is real smooth, your videos take on a floating feel, no more bouncing. The controls are very easy regardless of the modes, TILT, LOCK FOLLOW...the trigger allows quick re-centering, the buttons are well placed to control the movement of the gimbal, the focus and even the zoom buttons are well placed. If you have large hands, the grip may seem a little compact while trying to fit your hands but you can always use the tripod stand and increase the handle area. The extending stick is a little stiff to pull out but it does come in handy for self recording. \n\nOverall a very fun accessory for the best camera you already own , your PHONE.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The DJI Osmo 6 Phone Stabilizer Gimbal is a handheld device that using a gyro-type system, will let you place your smartphone on it, and it stabilizes the phone for photos and videos while you are handholding the device.  As you move, it moves with you, but your phone seems to “float” in it’s holder, not moving at all unless you get carried away and move too much or too fast.  But with normal panning, walking, even jogging, your photos and videos will remain pretty much motion/jerky free.\n\nThe Osmo 6 has a main body that consists of a hand grip and varied controls, along with an arm that extends (which turns it on when you do so).  A strong magnetic disk with stretching clips wraps around your phone and then sticks onto this arm, so you can use it while moving around.  The arm itself also has a telescoping feature so you can extend it and get more than 8 inches of reach as well (think of it as a souped-up selfie stick if you want).  A separate tripod attachment screws onto the bottom and has three legs you can extend – this way, you can use the Gimbal as a tripod for video, photo, podcasts, etc.  It’s a standard mount so you can also use many normal sized tripods as well.\n\nYou need to download the DJI app for best results.  Once installed and set up, your phone connects to the Osmo 6 via Bluetooth, and when you magnetically snap it onto the Gimbal, the app auto-launches on your phone.  There’s a variety of tutorials teaching you how to use the device, and it connects to your phone's album(s) with permission, so you can use it through the app.  It WILL work without the app, but I found some of the features to work in a clunky way without it.\n\nThe controls on the hand grip allow you to pan the camera, back and forth, up and down, control zoom and focus, flip from the main back camera to the front camera, re-center the phone, and track subjects of your choosing, and more.  Some buttons have more than one function based on how many times you click them.  I will say, the sheer number of click combinations for different functions at first seems a bit overwhelming and you will find yourself referring to the manual many times to remember what does what.  It’s not the best experience in my opinion, but in time, all of the combinations should begin to sink in.  \n\nThe Osmo 6 does work as advertised.  Panning at a fairly good clip, it keeps my video steadier than I can do by hand, even if I use the phone’s built-in stabilizer.  Likewise, if taking still photos and you are moving a bit, it will help keep things steady hence, sharper photos and videos. I have a medical condition that sometimes makes it hard to remain super steady, and this definitely made a huge difference. I’ve only seen one or two millisecond hiccups where it stalled, but it hasn’t been common.  The motor is not loud.  Battery life is very good, and it charges via a USB-C port on the side of the main body.  A battery icon on the main body tells you when you’re low.  \n\nThis isn’t the type of device that every person with a phone will want to invest in or spend the money for, especially if you really just use your phone for casual photography with an occasional video.  But if you are more serious about your pics and vids and take a good number of both, and/or you like to experiment with podcasting or making more semi-pro videos, then it’s a worthy investment to make your media look more professionally done.  Not perfect, but recommended if you need it.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I needed a gimbal to produce some good quality video off my iPhone and ended up with professional results ! I was asked to collaborate with a cabinetry company and shoot video clips for a kitchen remodel project I designed and built. It was a breeze! The DJI-Osmo Mobile 6 combined with the included Bluetooth connection and video software worked seamlessly. The tutorials had me up and running quickly and were able to refer back to when I had a question. The depth of control was very good and allowed me to dive deeper into filming. One segment had me filming myself and the \"follow\" feature allowed me to move and demonstrate my kitchen design features while it kept me in the frame. The gimbal created smooth motion as I zoomed in or panned across shots. Perfect for B-Roll clips you can use for a video. It also was great at taking stills with the built-in tripod feature. All camera controls are by buttons and triggers on the handle (Bluetooth connected to your phone) of the DJI Osmo 6 , start, stop, zoom, etc from the handle as you shoot the video.....Warning ! this gimbal may cause you to daydream about what you would say in your acceptance speech at the Oscars !",

        "comment": "The first OSMO I got was the Mobile 2. It was my first gimbal. It was fine at first but it I had to keep rebalancing it. I can't keep the phone on there because it's a phone and I use it other than a camera.\n\nThe Mobile 6 solves this. It can \"auto\" balance my phone. I'm using the iPhone 14 Pro Max with a case. I even have a bluetooth receiver for a microphone and can handle the size and weight. The app works well with iOS. The follow/tracking mode has improved and works well. It folds up nicely and compact. You can use the tripod extension that comes with it or use a different tripod.\n\nWarning to Android users, there is no official listing of the app from the play store. You will need to enable third party support and download the apk from DJI.",

I had another gismo brand prior and did not like it. It could not hold my iphone eventho the ad stated it would. My phone was too heavy.

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The DJI Osmo Mobile 6 is DJI’s latest phone gimbal promising an all in one experience. This gimbal combines a gimbal and selfie stick into one along with DJI’s Mimo app for “efficient shooting, editing, and sharing” which may or may not be your actual experience. After a few days I have to say this gimbal isn’t for everyone. \n\nIn the Box:\n\n-\tOsmo Mobile 6 Gimbal\n-\tMagnetic Phone Clamp\n-\tGimbal Tripod\n-\tPower Cable\n-\tStorage Bag\n\nSetup:\n\nFor best results, you need to download the DJI app which is where you might start to notice a different perspective in the overall user experience whether you are an IPhone or Android user. For Android, you must download the app via APK (because the Google Play Store does not have an official app to download). The APK warns you that the file may contain viruses and harm your device. Chances are it will not but it’s not something you feel overly enthused about.\n\nAfter the app is installed, the phone connects to the gimbal via Bluetooth. The phone itself sits inside a magnetic clamp and then snaps on and off of the gimbal. The process is very simple to get the phone on and off of the gimbal however the clamp may sit in a problem spot depending on your phone design. This varies greatly but if you have buttons in the center or just off center of the edges on your phone, this may be a problem.\n\nThe bottom of the gimbal features a threaded mount to install the tripod mount. Simply screw it on and off and it acts as a tripod. If you want to use the selfie stick function of the gimbal just pull the end up/out and you can use the gimbal in an extended mode.\n\nThe buttons on the hand grip gimbal portion allow you to control most functions of the gimbal/phone app without using the touch screen of the phone itself. You can change modes of the type of shot you want, pan, tilt, control zoom and focus, flip camera views, re-center your phone, and activate/disable active track, etc. If you double click some buttons it will act as different functions. If you are familiar with other DJI products, this will seem very intuitive.\n\nUsage:\n\nThe gimbal does exactly what it claims. It will keep the phone nearly perfectly steady with little effort on your end. This will be substantially better than any optical/digital stabilization in your phones camera from the factory. Sometimes if may often work better with the gimbal if you disable any stabilization on your phone while using the gimbal but this is optional and your experience may differ depending on the phone. \n\nMy only issue that I ran into was the pivot point for the selfie stick always was at the wrong angle when you put it back down into its regular position. So the bottom motor would rub on the edge of the plastic body. It does feel quite delicate when you are pull and pushing on the stick to raise and lower it but I suppose that’s what it was designed to do. \n\nOverall:\n\nThe DJI Osmo Mobile 6 is a great gimbal for your phone to achieve cinematic like footage with excellent stabilization. My biggest complaints are more to do with the Mimo app rather than the gimbal itself. For years, DJI have not released official apps on the Play Store for some reason. I wish they would release an official build so people don’t have to feel like they are letting access to their phone via an APK. In addition, the features should be better optimized for the Android platform like they are for IPhone users. Outside of this, I believe it is a very useful tool for those looking for an affordable all-in-one type of device to create better content.",

        "comment": "The Osmo Mobile 6 includes several shooting modes, including ActiveTrack 4.0, which allows the gimbal to automatically track and follow a subject, and Gesture Control, which allows you to take selfies or start/stop recording by making hand gestures.\n\nIn terms of battery life, the Osmo Mobile 6 has a run time of up to 7.5 hours, which is an improvement over its predecessor. It also features a USB-C port for charging your phone while you're using the gimbal.\n\nOverall, the DJI Osmo Mobile 6 is an excellent smartphone gimbal that offers a great balance of features, ease of use, and portability. If you're looking for a way to improve the quality of your smartphone video footage, the Osmo Mobile 6 is definitely worth considering.",

        "comment": "The bad:\n1. The app isn't on the play store I would assume because it doesn't meet Google's guidelines.  You need to change phone settings to allow this install.\n2. It only supports the 1x and 3x cameras on the Galaxy S22 Ultra.  Why have a zoom wheel if it can't even access the 10x optical camera?  Also, the 0.6X camera is a no go.\n3. Active track has trouble starting using the hand signal when the background is busy.\n4. Camera and Video functionality is very limited in the mimo app.  No HDR, only 30fps support, no geotagging photos, no pro camera etc..   If you switch to the default phone camera app you cant even use the start/stop button on the gimbal, there is 0 connectivity there. \n5. The ability to look down is very limited. Placing this on a table using its mini stand you cannot look down very far.\n6. Active track only works on the 1x lens.  As soon as you hit 3x it stops zooming while active track is on.  \n\nThe Good:\n1. It is light, quick to setup and not much of a learning curve.\n2. It fits the large S22 Ultra in a thin case and motors can handle it. \n3. Active track when working is great.  \n4. Gimbal serves the purpose of making video smooth.\n5. Price isn't bad compared to other DJI gimbals.\n\nI could get over almost all the negatives if they could get all the cameras supported on this popular phone and if active track could work across each camera.  \n\nPhoto is GoPro in the Volta Handle next to the Insta360 X3, next to this OM6 Gimbal, next to the Ronin SC Gimbal with a APS-C camera.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Overall - Crazy fast feature rich gimble Loaded with Features !\n\n\nThis is great fun and turns your cell phone into device that shoots incredibly good video in almost any situation. A mature and feature rich software support means you can connect a phone, pop it on and just go at it in a few minutes. If you have never used a gimble before - I would recommend the built in tutorial along with YouTube tips and tricks.\n\nAs someone who owns two other older gimbles - This instantly outmoded them. The functionality offered and the reaction speed with which this works is roughly one internet year ahead of anything else I have used. It's awesome.   \n\nSoftware - It just works. Install the app, pair the device and allow it permissions. The controls just work as they should on both my older android and current iPhone. First time setup was under 2 with both phones I tried. \n\nReal World Size and Weight - Folds to very compact. Weight = 1.01Lbs which I consider negligible if you are carrying other gear. I budget packing space in common things I \"know\" - I.e. this device takes the  space of one 16oz bottle of water in my day hike-bike-trip bag.\n\n\"Torture Testing\" - I tried every listed feature on the website - they all worked !  \nI did this as a way to familiarize myself with the controls after completing the built in tutorial as\n well as a tips and tricks on YouTube tutorial. For laughs I threaded it into a mount I have on my mountain bike bars. Trail riding is notoriously hard to shoot whereas you want some amount of jolts and bumps to make it feel more real to the viewer -  It kept up ! I then realized I could use that to grab some subject tracking shots of a buddy I was riding with. Much to my surprise I ended up some really cool footage via that technique whereas I was only trying to test out the stabilization in what I considered an impossible shooting scenario. Next, an idea struck - Subject track a far off object to the side while riding a trail - cool shots of everything whipping by. This gimble is unstoppable and vastly exceeded my expectations ! \n\nPros - \nReaction Speed is top notch !\nCAN be charged/powered while in use.\nMature product software + constant software improvements. \n\nCons - \nSlight learning curve - The tutorial and YouTube are your friends !\nIs it waterproof ? - No.    \n\nOverall - Love it ! I'll be handing down or recycling two other gimbles and I'll likely purchase a second one shortly.",

        "comment": "I'm not sure how this wasn't included in any reviews, but this basically doesn't work with Android. The DJI Mimo App is not in the Play store and if you go to the DJI website to try to download it, you get a sketchy APK that is blocked by like 99% of IT administrators. Reading between the lines, there must be some serious security and/or stability concerns with this app, and it's supposed to be user friendly so APK hacking around security restrictions is not exactly the \"start it up right out of the box\" they advertise. The app is not extraneous either, most of the buttons don't work if you don't have the app, basically you can just pan up, down, and side-to-side. Zoom doesn't work, record doesn't work, none of the other buttons do anything. Total waste of money.",

The lronlem is the biggest reason i pirchased was for perfectly framed level shots. However i have to manually adjust the gimble 2 degrees every time to get it level. Defeats the puppse of using the magnets to quickly attach your phone  for a quick shot. Each time i have to open up the app after phone is connected and adjust 2 degrees :(",

Occasionally my iphone 11 shows the gimbal in the frame (only when on 0.5 view) but it honestly does not bother me because this thing is so cool. I love the stitching feature for panoramic photos. I also love the LightCut app which makes editing videos a breeze. If you’re thinking about getting this, do it. You wont regret it!",

        "comment": "I honestly love this gimbal! I’ve had other gimbals before and hardly used them because it simply took too long to balance my phone every time! Sure this gimbal has a limited range of motion… but the best gimbal is one that you use! This one, you stick the magnet on the middle of your phone, and then it takes literally 5 seconds to be completely set up and ready to go every time after that. The gimbal is also small, so it fits right in to my Fanny pack! Also like the extension",

        "comment": "I recently purchased the Dji Osmo mobile 6 Mobile Gimbal and I have been blown away by its performance. It has quickly become my go-to accessory when shooting video on my phone.\n\nThe gimbal is incredibly easy to use and provides smooth, stable video footage. It has helped me capture stunning footage on-the-go and has saved me countless hours of video editing in post-production.\n\nOne of the things I love about this gimbal is its compact size. It easily fits in my pocket or camera bag, making it a great tool for traveling. It also has a long battery life so I can shoot for hours without needing to recharge.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend the Mobile Gimbal to anyone who wants to take their mobile videography to the next level. It is a must-have accessory for anyone who wants to capture stunning video footage on their phone.",

Other than this, I couldn't justify spending $160. So I searched online and found an extension rod for just under $20. Osmos6 uses the same software to edit and create as Osmos3, so i decided to return it. Also, Osmos3 came with a hard case while this doesn't.  The build quality on the O3 seemed sturdy and better in my hands (large hands).",

        "comment": "I originally had a mouse with a USB receiver that I used with my laptop and I loved it, since it had the Bluetrack tech, But my laptop died and I had to get a new one. Unfortunately the new laptop doesn't have the USB type A connection so was looking for a new one. Let me just say I didn't completely read the description, so I was pleasantly surprised to see this has the Bluetrack tech which allows me to use it anywhere I want without needing a mouse pad. It is super easy to set up since it's  Bluetooth. I have no problems with it, It automatically connects once I turn it on, and maybe I'm comparing it to my past mouse that was years old, but this one is super fast, the scroll wheel work perfectly, the click are a bit on the loud side but I don't mind. I knew the button in the bottom doubles as an on and off switch since I read some reviews so Thank you! It's comfortable to use for long periods of time and since it's thin I can throw it on my accessories bag without it using too much space. The quality feels great and I like the fact that the battery cover is magnetic. The color does not looks as dark as the picture showed it so it didn't match my laptop but it still looks good so I'm keeping it. All in all it's a good mobile mouse!",

You’ll be left in anger as they will connect and disconnect about 15 times in a matter of minutes and trying to get them to connect back is a pain.

He was able to do it mostly without any assistance and it kept him occupied for a cold winters afternoon! He is just now transitioning from bigger legos/duplos to smaller lego and this is a great set for that transition. After putting it together he has played with the set for days after. It is so good for problem solving in building the set and imaginative play with playing with the set. He especially loves the guys and the dog. This set is great alone but also compliments other sets to build a bigger play set. I would highly recommend for all kids 5 and up!",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Razer Kaira Pro is a black headset with green accents that matches the color of the Xbox systems. While it totes as being a headset for Xbox, you can technically use it with anything that connects to bluetooth. It features two plush, comfy headphones, a detachable microphone and a lux braided charging cord. The headphones feature the razor logo that changes a variety of colors while in use- from green to purple to blue to yellow etc. I mean, they look really cool. But, they’re just as functional as they are stylish. The ear cups twist at a 45 degree angle making it extremely easy to take them on and off. Taking them out of the package, I was very impressed by the super clean and sleek design. It truly felt like I was opening up a luxury item. These are the most comfortable headphones that I’ve ever worn. They have breathable, memory foam air cushions. I love how easy the mic is to detach- it just plugs into a jack. It was extremely easy to pair my headphones with my Xbox as well as my phone via Bluetooth when I just wanna listen to music. Another fun feature, is that all of the controls are on the ears in the headset itself. One ear features the power button, a mic mute switch and a volume dial that beeps when you’ve reached maximum volume. The other ear features a Bluetooth button and a game/chat balance wheel to increase the in-game volume and decrease the voice chat volume or vice versa. The Razer HyperClear Supercardoid Mic gives you crystal clear talk sound. This is an awesome pair of headphones that are super functional and stylish at the same time! This is for that next level gaming!",

        "comment": "Since Black Friday is going on wanted to share my experience. Have had these since March of 2022 and I have to say these are hands down the best headphones under $100 when on sale, they are a steal! At full price I feel for $30 more you should opt for the new Nova 7x by Arctis.\n\nPros\n- Sound Quality\n- Ease of use (Built for Xbox so there is a razer xbox app in the xbox store for tuning)\n- Amazing FPS, pair this with the free Microsoft Sonic or purchase Dolby Atmos and you have full spacial hearing\n- Mic is awesome, Team can always here me even when I whisper, it does pick up background noise as well so don't annoy your friends with music in the background\n\nCons\n- Connection, at times the connection randomly drops for no reason at all, they just disconnect for a few seconds. It's very annoying especially when playing something like MW2 because you lose that edge. I have yet to figure out what causes the drop\n- Noise Canceling, it's pretty good at blocking out most noises but if you live in a noisy city you will 100% here the trash trucks, traffic, etc. If you sit close to a window that is, if you are already pretty well isolated then these are perfect ( Parents you might have to go tap your kids on the shoulder to get their attention )\n\nOverall these are great cans, at $90 when on sale. As mentioned at full price there are already other great competitors but at $90 there is no comparison. If you are thinking on passing on these don't. If you have an extra $70 to spare go for the Turtle Beach 700 Gen 2 Max, those are hands down the best under $200 cans when on sale lastly is money is no object, buy the Arctis Nova Pros (Wired or Wireless) Hands down the best gaming headphones in existence at the moment.\n\nHappy Holidays!",

        "comment": "I needed a pair of wireless headphones that had a solid mic, these have provided exactly that. \nPros:\n- Sound is really good, just make sure to mess around with the EQ settings in the Razer app (on Xbox).\n- Build is pretty good, it's comfy and my ears don't feel cooked after a session. I'm not a fan of the green but it's not like I'm looking at them while I play, so not a big deal. The detachable mic is very handy.\n- It has a dedicated headphones app on Xbox, no other Xbox headset provides that. It also has a feature that allows you to hear yourself and your surroundings better when you're gaming, great feature for voice chat. \n- I was a bit worried about the mic, but it turned out to be great.\nCons:\n- Absolutely not worth the price, while it is comfy and a good build, it's still cheap and $200 isn't justified. Get it for $120 if you can.\n- Sometimes the audio gets choppy for no reason, while I have been able to eliminate the issues myself, I've heard users report long term audio issues, so keep that in mind.\n\nAll in all, I'm happy with it. I wish I didn't have to buy an extra headset in the first place, since I love my XM4's, but that's the way it is nowadays.\n\n4/5",

        "comment": "Sound is very crisp but doesn't get too loud. I had an arctis 9 before this and it broke so I had to replace it.  I thought that the Steelseries headset was bad because it would it would periodically turn off without notice and drove me nuts but I will say I miss it now.\nThere were a number of good reviews for this headset which I find very puzzling but I think it's because the reviewers didn't use it as much with bluetooth on at the same time. \nThe sound is often distorted and requires frequent resets, and this includes times when I am not using bluetooth. And I mean multiple resets every gaming session.\nIf I turn the balance heavily to bluetooth, it will reliably disconnect from the xbox with no notification.\nI am unable to turn it on to use for bluetooth without turning on the xbox, which is fine and how the Arctis was. Conversely, if I turn off the xbox the headset will automatically turn off even if I am connected to my phone which is just mind-boggling.\nWhen it works, it is fine. My speech seems to be clear and the microphone doesn't have to be too close to my mouth.  Reading about it is very impressive, but it is so horrendously unreliable. I wouldn't buy from them again.",

        "comment": "Seems like a great purchase so far. I bought one for my son and one for myself. Gaming without extra wires plugged into controller is amazing. Sound quality is very good, quick and easy set up. Battery hasn’t been an issue. Make sure you do a full charge on headset before use approx 4 hrs. All considered we are both very happy for the price (sale) and quality of headphones.",

        "comment": "Simple - hooked them up to my Series X and the sound is absolutely terrible.  Tons of distortion.  Most up-to-date firmware and default EQ, and things just sound bad (games, Twitch, YouTube, video, etc).  I love Razer products, usually ... but I'll be returning these and I highly recommend you pass.  Apparently there's a reason they were significantly discounted.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My son had broke a lot of the wired headsets for use with the Xbox Series X.  A couple of them only last a couple of months before he somehow broke or messed up the wires.  This has been great, no issues with connectivity, sounds great and has great battery life.  He also prefers the sound in these versus the TV, so the room is quieter, just not him.",

        "comment": "The headset works exactly as advertised 99% of the time. In fact they are better than they're advertised as most of the time. I use them as my headphones for walking around the house, I use them for watching movies and the sound quality up and down the frequencies is amazing.\n\nProblem is the way the headset connects to the Xbox. \n\nIt connects using the same accessories function as the xbox controllers and remote controls. While this is an advantage being able to just connect straight to the console, no USB dongles, no wires, and all native, it also creates an intermittent distortion that cannot be remedied. It turns all your audio into a scratchy jumble to the point you can't make out what people in your party chat are saying to you. It only happens once in a while, but it's a known issue that has been around as long as these headphones have been on the market. \n\nIf you're looking for a competitive \"PRO\" gaming headset, this ain't it.",

        "comment": "The sound quality is very good for the price range.\nThey compare well highs and lows with many $200 plus headphones. I like the ability to listen from two different sources and have separate volume adjusters. I sometimes experience poor  connection beeping issues when using my desktop\nBut I feel it's due to a bad Bluetooth transmitter on my PC.",

The headphones are real comfortable after some extended play times.  The sound won’t blow away audiophiles, but it’s good enough for this set.  The mic is also doable, but nothing extraordinary.   Overall this a good set to own.",

        "comment": "Very nice headset at a sale price, but not as good as I had hoped.  Volume is good, with minimal distortion, however I found connection issues when using the app for controlling the equalizer and other customizations.  Headset could be more comfortable if the head band had thicker padding and covered a little more area on top of the head. Ear cups did a good job covering my ears but I found them to be a little loose.  I have an average size head and felt the cups could use a little more clamping force.  Overall sound was good and could be modified in the app directly from the Xbox.  Positional accuracy was very good when using Dolby Atmos.  Battery life is acceptable and as advertised.  I like the lighting on the ear cups, however it does take a toll on battery life.  I found it cut the battery life by approximately 25%.  Build quality is good and I have had no  problem connecting to my iPhone.  Firmware updates require access to a PC.  Updates are not possible on a MAC.",

Microsoft's version lacks the vibrations on the earcups when your being shot or attacked. It's still a rreally good headset however. My party and s quads can hear me crystal clear when I talk.",

This headset is replacing the turtle beach stealth 600 as one of the cups is failing.I’ve tried the hyper x clouds, turtle beach stealth 700, andsteel series arctic 9x. For 100 bucks the price is impossible to beat I ended up taking  the others back for various reasons, but this headset is worth it. Being able to customize all your settings right on the Xbox is awesome, no phone apps or needing a computer is also great.  My friends prefer the mic on this headset compared to the others it sounds precise, no  hissing or static. The only thing I would suggest is adjusting the EQ in the app when setting the headset up",

The sound quality is comparable to a string attached to a tin can. It sounds like the speakers are blown and everytime to sounds go slightly high it reverberates. The App for the xbox doesn't make anything better, the FPS settings seem to mute the footsteps rather than help the stick out more. The app for my phone will not connect and I've tried and retried every troubleshooting tip I could find. These are incredibly disappointing, especially for the cost.",

We personally don’t game to often with work schedules but, the original headset we had with our Xbox was unimpressive compared to these. They are super comfy with the padded ear muffs, fit perfectly on your head, and let me tell ya the sound alone is fantastic. These are my all time favorite when we get them weekends off to enjoy them! Also, I found that they connect to other devices leaving us some time to enjoy some music if necessary! I love this headset!",

HOWEVER there is one flaw aboutthis headset that nobody has pointed out and thats the power it pulls from the RGB part of the headset to give it life. The RGB of the headset drains the battery faster and pulls power from the drivers which in turn distorts the audio of the headset. If anyone headset shut the RGB off and turn has issues with that shut the RGB off and itll fix the audio issue. Otherwise with the headset its great quality just more functionality on the manufacturer side, I WILL UPDATE ONCE THEY RELEASE FIRMWARE TO FIX THIS.",

        "comment": "The in game sound provided by these headphones is amazing straight out of the box and a huge upgrade from the older Turtle Beach set I’ve been using. I’ve experienced one hiccup in connection due to game lag but I don’t think that was the fault of the headphones. The only reason I gave four stars instead of five is due to recent patches done by Microsoft Edge that won’t allow XOBOX Series S/X users to download the program needed for use of the custom sound mapping EQ program. All in all these are great headphones and well worth the price. You will have four preset sound choices to choose from even without the custom mapping. The sounds of gunfire in BF are crisp and rotor sounds are more realistic. Heavy explosions are deep and definitely will add to the immersive experience for any gamer.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My husband had a pretty good set of wired headphones, but these blow those away! It’s so nice having wireless headphones as he sometimes jumps around in excitement while playing and this doesn’t have a cord on it to yank on. The sound is great on these, and works well for games where you’d need to hear small noises such as someone sneaking up on you. It has greatly improved his gaming experience just for that simple feature! It picks up sounds that you wouldn’t necessarily hear from your tv.",

Extremely comfortable to wear due to the soft breathable cushion both for the ears and head. Sound quality exceeded my husband's expectations and there is no \"lag\" when communicating. My husband describes the sound as \"crisp and clear\". Pairs up easily and effortlessly as well. This is definitely a great addition to their Xbox collection, we already purchased a couple more for the kids and 1 as a gift. Highly recommend, will not disappoint.",

        "comment": "The headset is fine, but worth $200? Idk. The build quality is pretty solid despite it feeling like a cheap material. It’s relatively comfortable and light, a little tight at first but that gets better with continued use. My biggest issue is with connectivity. I’ve used it with the Series X and it connects well and the app allowing you to customize its settings is cool but, and maybe this is a problem with Xbox wireless technology in general, it tends to have poor connection with sounds pulsing. Like cutting in and out basically, idk really weird. Also you can’t turn the headset on without turning your Xbox on, which for me isn’t an issue but some might find it to be. Also the Bluetooth was one of the major reasons I bought this headset so I could use ot for both my Xbox and PC but apparently BT isn’t as far along as I thought. The headset sounds great through Bluetooth, a little delayed but that’s normal with BT but as soon as you try using the mic through BT the sound quality drops abysmally. Like unusually quality when it need the mic on Bluetooth. I ended up purchasing the Microsoft wireless adapter it was so unusable through Bluetooth.\nIn conclusion, decent headset in some areas, but really falls short in others.",

The sound is so great that u can customize the sound how ever u like. Once u put the headset on it feels like u can’t hear much that’s happening in the background.  When talking it sound great. There’s only one thing I don’t like, sometimes randomly u can hear a beep noise but it doesn’t happen constantly so that good.",

        "comment": "The connectivity and sound are really good for a gaming headset. The fit is very tight and hurt the top of my head after an hour of playing. So I returned it and got the new Steelseries Arctis Nova 7x instead. Razer is great and if the black shark V2 worked with Xbox I would’ve got that instead because the black shark is really comfy. The Bluetooth connectivity of the Kaira Pro is a nice plus. Black shark doesn’t have Bluetooth.",

But if you are wanting to ever be able to use the mic without an insane echo or have every single noise in the background (like your heartbeat) go through the mic. Do NOT get this headset. The mic is absolutely atrocious! And it has nothing in the settings for mic sensitivity.",

Great fitment (I wear glasses too) sound quality is solid after updating and some custom EQ settings. Occasionally blown-out sound that was resolved by just powering off and on. Things to note - you can use an app on your xbox to customize sound/power saving options. You will need a computer to update them.",

        "comment": "A lot of ultra portable mice meant for travel are so tiny and uncomfortable to use. MS got it right with the surface mobile mouse though. Opting for a similar design as their normal surface mouse but making it with a lower height profile keeps it far more usable, but lets it hide away in a bag really nicely.\n\nBluetooth connectivity makes it usable on most devices including android tablets/phones. [not that I see myself using it with my phone all that often, if at all.]\n\nA nice grab if your using a surface go with matching pen and type covers.\n\nThe aluminum scroll wheel feels good and quality, Been using it daily since I bought it.\n\nConnecting it to the surface was as easy as turning it on, setting it down next to the tablet and clicking the confirm button when the tablet asks if you would like to connect to the mouse. from there, it will automatically connect each time.\n\nPowering the mouse on, or off is as simple as pressing the bluetooth button on the underside. Holding the same button while on will set the mouse back into pairing mode if you would like to connect to another device. 2 AAA batteries included. [the ones that came with mine were Duracell Brand, much like what they pack in with xbox controllers. so expect good lengevity.]",

Also, it is very sturdy. \n\nI accidentally dropped this mouse down the stairs (ooops) and it bounced like 8 steps before hitting the floor (I have wood floors and wood stairs, btw) and there was only a tiny scuff on the left corner of the mouse from what I assume was the initial impact. You won't even notice it unless you already know it's there. It hit really hard. I panicked and thought I completely broke the mouse, but nope, still perfectly fine other than that tiny scuff. I just had to pop the batteries back in and the back cover to the batteries and it was all good to go. \n\nI've used it on my Surface Book 2 and even on my iPad Pro and it works flawlessly. I was a little sad that it was $30+, but hey, I've spent more on gaming mouses (mice?) that do not look as aesthetically pleasing. The clicking isn't quiet but it isn't too loud. It actually sounds kinda nice to me and the scrolling is smooth.\n\nI would recommend it to people looking for a simple, yet beautiful mouse for portability.",

The slim design and Bluetooth connectivity make it very portable. I haven't had to worry about the battery since I started using it. I don't think it's the most ergonomically correct design, but since I'm not using it for prolonged periods of time I'm not really too worried about it.",

It is a low pitched loud distracting sound! The Surface Pro only has two USB ports, one a USB-C and one USB-A. Logitech is my favorite, but it would occupy the USB-A port. And I would not trust other bluetooth mice due to reports of connectivity issues. Also, the mouse is really not very ergonomic, but does look sleek. The bluetooth pairing was amazingly quick. All told, I've decided to ignore the loud clicks and keep this device. I think I'll just wear my Bose noise-cancelling headset! :)",

After 4 months the battery still holds up, but I only use it 1-2 days a week. Battery drain has not been an issue for me.

I like the idea of storing it flat and all but it's just awkward to hold it, and use it. Instead, I've been using Logitech MX Anywhere 2S for my portable needs however, it is bit chunkier than Arc mouse.\n\nEnter Surface Mobile Mouse, it's slim enough for tightly packing in my portable gear setup, yet it's functional, somewhat ergonomically, and has premium feels and touch to it. \n\nBluetooth connectivity works perfect. I do want it to have multiple device connectivities with bluetooth and usb dongle but I am happy as it is. Highly recommended.",

The scroller is thin and has no grip.\n\nThe materials feel plastic-y and cheap, I think if you dropped it it would shatter into pieces. You can feel/hear this when you click the buttons. The bottom does not glide well on flat surfaces or mouse pads (I've tried both). Instead it feels like you're scratching the bottom when you move it. The Bluetooth connectivity is very spotty, it goes in and out.",

Of course it doesn't have all the gesture supports of a Magic Mouse, but it works well and tracks well with most desktop surfaces that I've used on.  My main complaint though is that similar to the Magic Mouse, this mouse is too flat and it doesn't feel comfortable on your hand for extended use.  But it does fit very well in a slim laptop sleeve that I use for holding my MacBook, if that's something that matters to you.",

        "comment": "With my elementary school kids (1st and 5th grade) needing to use PCs full time for remote learning, I wanted to get them a mouse to use in lieu of the of the trackpads on our surface devices.  While the trackpads work ok, it's just plain easier to navigate and type with a mouse.\n\nThe Surface Mouse does not disappoint.  It connects almost immediately after booting up the PC, it has very smooth tracking and ergonomically is very easy to hold.  My wife liked it so much, we ended up buying another one for her HP laptop - which connects just as quickly.  Definitely a worthwhile purchase considering the price.\n\nMy only nitpick is that it doesn't automatically turn off.  It's supposed to have good battery life, but I end up turning it off every night....just in case.",

The cursor seems to drag or lag when I use the mouse in rough or textured surfaces.  All other aspects of the mouse work great!  You can turn off the mouse by simply pressing the Bluetooth button located at the bottom of the mouse and it quickly connects to my Microsoft Surface Pro when I turn the mouse on.  Great product for its value!",

It is smaller than \"normal\" mice in the very best dimension -- it simply isn't as \"thick\" or \"tall\" as most regular mice. That allows it to fit in bags nicely, while still resulting in a mouse that's as easy to use as any \"normal\" mouse. It is also has absolutely excellent build quality -- this is a premium mouse in every way. I guess it's also worth mentioning that Microsoft offers this mouse in a number of different colors -- for instance, I bought a silver-colored one to go along with my silver-colored notebook computer. I sure like that better than using one of the far more usual black-colored mice.",

The ease of connecting to my surface book was seamless. The clicks aren’t too loud either which was a concern of mine. If you’re trying to decide between this mouse and the Arc mouse, you need to know they serve different functions. If you’re used to the normal grip of a mouse, go with this one (and if you don’t want to dish out $80, yikes!)",

It is meant for the Microsoft Surface tablet, which is why it is a more slim, compact mouse, but I use it for my Windows 10 desktop and love it. It is Bluetooth, so no USB dongle, and it connected to my computer automatically. Excellent product for the $35 pricetag. I feel it is a superior product to the under-$20 mice, and worth the money. Will buy again if needing another mouse in the future.",

No on/off on mouse and battery pack cover is magnetic rather than screw which is a nice touch. Mouse is responsive and buttons feel great. My only gripe is that I would really have enjoyed a rechargeable version of this via USB rather than the old school double AA battery reliance.",

The on/off is a tiny button that is flush with the underside so you will need a pen or pencil to turn it on and off easily. So far it has been able to take a beating. I travel with mine so it gets dropped and tossed into the carrying case on a regular basis. The bluetooth set up was easy. No need to tie up a usb port. Its a little pricey for a mouse.",

The scroll wheel is nice and the L / R clicks are tactile and audible. The precision is good for everyday tasks, office work, and general use. I don't think I could recommend this mouse for gaming, but if you're reading reviews for this mouse, then chances are, you're not looking for a gaming mouse. \n\nI was able to pick this thing up for around $22 dollars when BestBuy had some sales going on. If you're thinking about it, then wait for the sales and get one. I actually got two. I got a silver/platinum one, and a sandstone (rose gold / pink) color for my girlfriend. They are great mice! I only wish I could have got one in burgundy to match my surface. It's okay, I'm still really satisfied.",

Hand gets tired real quick due to the the hand and wrist wants to craddle the mouse and causing strains.\n\nGood side:  It connects through blue tooth and pretty much gets a mouse on any screen or device.  No need for the usb stub or for device that lacks a usb port.",

I am using it on a glass table right now and have been doing so for the past two weeks.",

Some were unsteady. \n\nWhich led me to shelling out the cost for this Joby telepod mobile tripod. I've used it through the Christmas festivities and it provided that extra hand to take group pictures. \n\nPro: I like how compact it is, in that it fits in my small purse. The selfie stick is comfortable in the hand. I like how easy it is to use. I like the 3 legs, it's quite stable, especially on cobble stone paths. \n\nCon: Slight con, the telescope lock isn't so obvious, so it takes a few tries to lock them. \n\nOther than  the slight con, I am very satisfied with this tripod and I can't wait to use it during my solo travels.",

I think it is a remote camera trip for some phones. Construction is very good and proper materials were used to make a quality piece of equipment.\n\nIt does have a phone holder but I bought another version with threaded fastener on bottom and top so I could stack the 3D Scanner on top.",

The reason for the 4 stars instead of the 5 is because it's not really a plug and play thing. Also the remote is easily knocked off its holder. I wound up carrying the remote the whole time. \nDownload the app, and try it out before you need to.",

The detachable remote is very handy away from the tripod and out of the way when attached. I’m happy.",

        "comment": "Difficult to find a good retractable iPhone holder/stand but the Joby TelePod (Model: JB01550) does the job. I needed something quick and found, for the price, it is a good value: lightweight and sturdy. I do recommend that if using as a stand, attach it to a 2.5 lb or more shot bag to prevent a strong wind from knocking it over. Currently, I use the JOBY TelePod to hold my Logitech - 4K Pro 4096 x 2160 Webcam (also purchased at Best Buy). As for the remote it does NOT stay attached to the handle at all, so I highly recommend you get a separate keychain ring and make it detachable. That way you can put in your pocket for remote picture and or video control. The holder clip for the phone is a pressure clamp and is okay. Not great and definitely not action shooting grade. If you want something for that, I recommend getting a Bower WA-TM100 360° Rotating Smartphone Tripod Mount – always good to have in your gear bag.",

        "comment": "I had high hopes because it looked nicely designed and was compact. When I got the tripod, I was impressed by its clever design. You twist the telescoping shaft to unlock/lock it in position. I thought that was fun and a nice way to remove another knob.\n\nHowever, when I went to use this thing, any adjustment of the phone inevitably unlocked the telescope and the tripod would go limp in my hand as it became completely unsupported.\n\nThe ball lock was also not strong enough to hold cell phone. Once direction of rotation would just start to un-thread the phone mount and the phone would crash down very quickly. The other direction, the phone position would creep downward, changing the shot. Trying to put the camera back would then inevitably unlock the extension.\n\nAdditionally, the manufacturing quality was not very good. All three legs opened up to different angles. This means the center shaft was always a few degrees off of vertical. I'm not sure this actually affected functionality, but it made it look bad. That's something I could forgive on a $30 product, but not a $65 one.\n\nYes, I am returning this. It was a clever idea that just was not executed well.",

Despite the saying Surface, I just use this with a regular laptop.\n\nI got this for work because wouldn't you know it, in an effort to make laptops smaller and smaller, they keep removing useful things like extra ports. I was using a hub for my other keyboard and mouse (and other peripherals), but discovered that it would occasionally causes stutters as there was too much activity going through all the ports.\n\nThis mouse uses Bluetooth which frees up a port for license dongles (which won't work though a USB hub). There is no lag whatsoever for regular office use. The battery life is rather good. I use rechargeable batteries and have only needed to replace them once over the duration of my nearly 1.5 years of owning and using this mouse. You can also see the estimated battery life on your computer if you need to find it in the Bluetooth & other devices control panel. It'll also warn you when it is getting low so you don't unexpectedly have it die on you. I just checked it again and I'm at 60% still.\n\nThe only con to this mouse is that it doesn't have a back/forward button, but it is not a deal-breaker.",

Great blue tooth connection, very smooth, and can be used on most surfaces.  Obviously, for best results use it on a mouse pad or a hard, flat surface (unless that hard, flat surface is a hot stove top). However, if you're feeling lazy in bed or on the couch without a mouse pad, I've had mine successfully work on blankets and arm rests.  As long as you're not trying to run it over water or ragged rocks or anything like that...but hopefully you're not using a laptop in those conditions anyway.",

These are relegated to the travel bag and used only on the road - I can't imagine using this a full time mouse at home or the office as there are much better ergonomic choices out there.\n\nFunctionally, it can handle all the surfaces I used it on and cannot complain about the BOGO price.",

Of course it doesn't have all the gesture supports of a Magic Mouse, but it works well and tracks well with most desktop surfaces that I've used on.  My main complaint though is that similar to the Magic Mouse, this mouse is too flat and it doesn't feel comfortable on your hand for extended use.  But it does fit very well in a slim laptop sleeve that I use for holding my MacBook, if that's something that matters to you.",

I'm really happy to not have to deal with the USB dongle my last wireless mouse used.  Seems to be very happy under Windows 10, but I've not attempted to use it with anything else yet.  If it doesn't behave with Linux or a Mac, I'll come back and dock it a star or two.  I bought the red one at the same time, so switching out based on mood...  (Microsoft had a promo that made 2 mice $30 instead of $35 each.)",

        "comment": "Like most hardware that bears the Surface name, Microsoft did all the little things right. The bluetooth pairing for this mouse is fast and reliable; Windows 10 recognized the mouse right away. The aluminum mouse wheel feels great. The mouse itself is lightweight but feels substantial. The battery compartment cover, attached magnetically, is novel. Finally, I've used this mouse on a variety of surfaces (tabletops, counters...) and the lazer eye is accurate on all of them. For $35, you get a simple, well-built mouse that feels built to last.",

I’ve had previous poor experiences with Bluetooth only mice but this one is amazingly accurate. Just like any other wireless mouse that would otherwise require a dongle. Bought it for my Surface and cot this color to match the laptop itself. It felt a bit shallow and thin at first but that was something I quickly got used to. Highly recommend if in the market for a Bluetooth mouse.",

Paired to my surface go almost instantly out of the box. \n\nBeing as thin as it is it does hold a little odd compared to a normal mouse. But I really like it would definitely buy again.  If I had to only choose one thes or the pen I would choose this. Only thing I wish it had a way to turn it off when not in use but that isn't that big of a deal.",

But, it is almost uncomfortably too small. My hand wants to grip something more substantial, it just does not stick up high enough for great comfort.. I can live with it if for awhile. I will probably get something else for those times when I will be spending significant time requiring a mouse.",

It's more on the flat side.",

        "comment": "I have a tablet that I don't like the finger pad on. I originally went to BB to purchase a usb mouse, and thankfully the BB rep showed me the Bluetooth mouse options. It made sense to try this route so as to keep the 1 usb port on my tablet free. I purchased this Microsoft Bluetooth mouse along with another name brand Bluetooth mouse that had similar reviews to the Microsoft one. They were both on sale for around the same price, but the original price of the other one was higher. I figured I would try both out and return the one I didn't like as much. I tried the Microsoft one first because I thought I would like it better based on the smaller size, 4-way scroll option, only needing 1 battery (compared to the other one needing 2), overall design, and a few other reasons. I was right. Everything worked so well, that I didn't even try out the other mouse. The Microsoft mouse is lightweight but doesn't seem \"cheap\" to me. It responds perfectly and linked up flawlessly with the Bluetooth settings on my tablet. It also comes with a much longer warranty (either 3 or 4 years, but I can't remember) than the other brand, which only had 1 year. Great price. Great product. Hope this helps. Thanks. Matthew 7:12",

You cannot rule out problem will not occur with the BT feature on your device connecting to the mouse. USB always works as long as you have an open port. Go the more reliable route with USB type.",

        "comment": "Nice Bluetooth mouse. Small and portable. If comfort is important, you will want to purchase a full-size mouse instead of this mouse.\r\n\r\nThe mouse has a single small recessed button for on, off and Bluetooth-sync. A separate rocker-switch for on-off would have been a better design - obviously. I guess Microsoft thought it was important to save $0.01 by not have a separate switch. Read the instructions to figure out how to use this combo-button. Microsoft has probably already lost money from the confusion and complexity of a combo-button.\r\n\r\nI'm using this mouse with a new, top-of-the-line HP notebook computer with Windows 10 and Bluetooth 4.2 LE (low energy). I have experienced no problems with connectivity.\r\n\r\nI have the cursor sensitivity set to the fastest setting and it still feels like I need to push the mouse a little bit too far to get the cursor to move as much as I would like. Perhaps a new Microsoft mouse driver will help that. I'm currently using the default Windows 10 mouse driver.",

I’ve tried moving the mouse closer to my computer, that didn’t help. I bought a mousepad (even though when I first used it I didn’t need to) and that didn’t help. There’s nothing more irritating than when you need this mouse to work and it doesn’t. For the time now, it will do, but I will be looking for another one.",

It's not for gaming.\n\nI purchased this Bluetooth mouse due to a connectivity issue stemming from my HP Spectre X360's connectivity issues with my old Logitech K317.  (The K317 - and the K360 keyboard - still work perfectly on every other device.)\n\nThis mouse has a constant, solid, dependable Bluetooth connection.  It is roughly the same size as the Logitech K317 which is itself about the right size for a normal-sized hand.  I prefer this mouse to the Logitech because it's less slippery on the sides and the scroll wheel.\n\nI might have to buy a few of these to connect to my other machines.",

I keep forgetting to turn it off after use!! I'm so use to a wired mouse (if I use a mouse) my battery is dying quickly!!!

Doesn't have the extra buttons on the side that quite a few mice have, but I don't really ever use those anyway.  Wheel and buttons are a little noisier than some other mice.  Like that it's bluetooth so don't have to mess with a dongle.  Comfortable in hand.  Only uses a single AA - have yet to see if its life is consistent with product claims.  At $20, it's a bit more than the no-name bluetooth mouse I'd purchased several years ago that only recently has been losing its connection - I think I paid about $10 for that one.  Guess the extra $10 is for Bill.",

Using it is pretty comfortable. I have big hands, so using a smaller than usual mouse is not easy. Which brings up to my last point...\r\n\r\nCon: If your looking for a compact, travel mouse, this might not be for you. I still take it everywhere, but it's not compact at all.\r\n\r\nOverall: There's really nothing I can say about it that's bad. So far, I don't have any issues. It's just a users preference when and how to use it. It's a good buy.",

It makes a really nice travel mouse (compact in size and no cords, connectors, or plug-ins to fool with), and it works great, in general, with very good resolution, but it doesn't work on glass, and sometimes it seems a little slow to respond on a non-solid surface (e.g. loose cloth). On a solid surface (like a desktop, tabletop, or tight fabric), absolutely no problems. \r\n\r\nP.S. Just make sure that whatever device you may want to use this mouse with is compatible with Bluetooth 4.0, the level that this mouse uses.",

I have found that the Microsoft version is not as easy to manipulate as the Logitech version, doesn't roll as well, and because the on/off button is a press-down button, it is hard to tell when the mouse is off, as compared to the Logitech on/off switch. The Microsoft version is also heavier and more mounded, so it is not as comfortable in my small hand. I would not buy the Microsoft mouse again.",

The only way I've found to get it going again is to turn off the bluetooth on the computer then turn it back on and let the mouse reconnect.  Needless to say, this really doesn't work for me.

I constantly am moving from home to the shop, coffee shops and whatnot, and this mouse fits nicely in my bag with my laptop and charger. I&#39;ve used it on uneven surfaces, and as long as I have my mouse pad, have had no problems.  I like not having a cord or wifi usb bit to worry about while taking my laptop around everywhere, also less pieces to loose along the way.  The click is soft and so is the scroll, which I find is a nice perk, feels like better quality. Has good control and moves smoothly.

It fits nicely in my small hand and the sides are of a nice material that lets you comfortably rest your thumb (and pinkie, if you're like me) against them without being slippery. I really like that it has a power switch, too, because I don't leaving things on when I'm not using them, so I can turn the mouse off overnight or if I'm not using my laptop for prolong times.\n\nThe mouse is perfectly symmetrical, so I think it could work just as well with predominant left hand users, so long as you can change the settings on your computer and tell it that the right button of the mouse will be the primary button (unless you don't mind using your middle finger as your primary button-clicking finger).",

        "comment": "after swiping my tablet screen a million times, and needing to clean it very often, I looked for a Blue Tooth Mouse to move me along quicker. It works very well, even using a magazine to set it on instead of a mouse pad. Family laughed when I bought it, after watching the ease of using it flawlessly, they also purchased one for themselves. Just wish the red \"ON\" indicator was on the top and visible so you knew when to switch it off. Other than that, buy one of you can find one, they sell out quickly",

        "comment": "I am never sure this mouse will work with my new Windows 10 laptop. I’ve had to pair it repeatedly even though it is listed as a device that is “working properly”. No mouse movements. No click. Nothing. My first attempt was to delete, then re-add it. I could not add it again until I updated Windows to the latest release - 1709. After that, I successfully re-added it, only to find after shutdown then boot a day or two later, it’s not working again. So instead of deleting it, I paired it again even though I see it plainly in the device list. So now I have 3 identical MS mice connected. I am thinking of returning it and get something else. I wanted the wireless Bluetooth so I can free up a USB port. Oh, and I am on my third battery, thinking that was the problem. It worked today. Will see if it works tomorrow. :(",

I write this review in part with a decade+ old wired, optical mouse. This bluetooth mobile mouse is no exception. It features easy set-up, nice laser response, a very comfortable grip, with snappy clicking, and a responsive scroll wheel. A perfect mouse to pair to a laptop with a poorly implemented touchpad.",

Tablet and laptop use however are ok. at first the mouse was really responsive and a great asset for AutoCAD and Solidworks (modelling programs). However after a few weeks I find the responsiveness to be spotty at times. Likely because it&#39;s Bluetooth but just keep that in mind",

No impact on my review, however, since it was purchased for the Air.\r\nWish list: it would be nice if it turned off after a period of inactivity. As is, it must be turned on and off manually, and it's easy to forget to turn it off.",

        "comment": "Very nicely constructed \"laptop-sized\" mouse with standard buttons, including an extra within the scroll wheel.\r\nPairs very easily with the computer in Bluetooth mode, and the tracking is excellent on all surfaces that I tried, including glass.\r\n\r\nIt uses a single AA battery which is easily accessible by an easily removable tab on the under-surface. Nearby, there is a small on/off button which activates a blue light, which will blink when put into bluetooth discover mode by simply holding down the \"on\" button for a short period. Once paired, the light glows continuously.\r\nUnfortunately, there is no illumination on the upper surface of the mouse to show that it is \"on\", so, it's easy to forget to turn it off; however, in the rest mode, fortunately little current is consumed so that failure to turn it off will impact relatively minimally on battery life.",

The interface is truly Bluetooth in the sense it doesn't require you to plug in a dongle to use the mouth, and thus frees up a USB port, which is a real plus. Pairing the device to your computer is very easy (assuming you use Windows 8.1 and up) and the connectivity is pretty good. Haven't faced any issue so far and really glad I bought it.",

It is smooth and truly enjoyable to use after fighting with a couple of Logitechs that work well with my HP laptop, but very inconsistent and jumpy. The only issue I have had with this (thus the 4 stars) is that is occasionally losses contact with my PC, and the only way to reconnect seems to be restarting the computer. That can be a real pain in the caboose. Otherwise, I love it.",

I chose this over the Microsoft Sculpt mouse because this design seems more ergonomic when in non-traditional locations like a recliner.\r\n\r\nMy connection has been stable, and I have not encountered any cursor delay.\r\n\r\nThe \"BlueTrack\" technology let this mouse work well on all the surfaces I've used.\r\n\r\nThere are no extra buttons, such as a back button. You may want to look elsewhere if this is important to you.\r\n\r\nBuild quality seems good, and there doesn't appear to be any exterior materials that'll wear out.\r\n\r\nI replaced a Microsoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 4000 with this model. It is roughly the same size, and it is nice to not have a USB transmitter.\r\n\r\nI'd highly recommend this mouse, unless you want extra buttons or a larger size.",

Being not that techy, it took me one hour to pair it to my Dell laptop. Once paired, I started scratching my head again because the mouse is still asleep. I browsed for answers online, paired & unpaired, and browse YouTube. After another long hour, I finally found a sensible suggestion on YouTube.  I almost gave up and was considering throwing this mouse into the valley of the cats.  Now it's awake and working hard. On my 2nd day of use, I panicked because it seemed this mouse is asleep again when I turned on my laptop.  After some guessing game, I was able to determined that you have to turn on the mouse first before turning on your laptop so it gets to connect to each other.  If you don't want this kind of panic every time you use this mouse & turn on your laptop.  Don't buy this",

        "comment": "My cardiologist suggested getting this unit - I have bradycardia and LBBB. It's a very simple unit, and I had it glued to the back of my iPhone for several months, taking ECG readings whenever I felt \"off\" or dizzy. The only correlate was when my HR fell below 40. Then I got tired of the iPhone being thicker and unstuck the unit, which I now leave on my desk and use separately. Alas, having the sensor unit separate presents its own problems - when I carry it in my pocket the battery falls out! It's easy to put back in, but I worry about it. The software app has been updated since I first got it, and I can't figure out some things that were easy before, like deleting a noisy reading. The app tries to detect if you have atrial fib, but not other conditions. It thinks my LBBB traces are \"Normal\" unless my HR is below 50, in which case it sort of gives up. My only other question about the system is how it smooths the data - the first few seconds of readings are really noisy with a lot of baseline drift, then suddenly it smooths out. Only sometimes it overlays a much faster pulse which it eventually decides to remove. Overall, very useful. Amazing it's so small.",

        "comment": "On the advice of my primary care physician (PCP), I purchased this device to be able to monitor myself for incidences of atrial fibrillation.  It could not have been easier to set up and to use.  Because my phone is 3 yrs old, before purchasing, I checked the AliveCor website to verify that my Android Samsung is compatible.  I had no difficulty downloading the App.  Getting readings of my heart rate and EKG was simple--it takes only 30 seconds.  After saving the results to my phone, I can email them to my PCP.  My cardiologist viewed the saved results at my next appointment, which was useful to confirm that I had experienced one incident of a-fib. (Note: He does not provide email access to his patients, and my EKG results cannot be uploaded to the patient portal.  He thinks it is good that I got the Kardia, but advised me to only record my EKG if I am feeling that I might be in a-fib.)   When using the Samsung Health App on my phone, I often have difficulty getting a reading of my heart rate, which is measured with a finger sensor. There is no such issue on the Kardia.  Overall, I think this is a great device to have--especially during the pandemic!",

        "comment": "My five star rating is for the monitor itself and the concept.  I use it twice a day and it saves me from taking coumadin et. al. on the off chance that my A-fib might return.  For that alone I would give it ten stars.  However, I feel that the software could badly use some improvements:  1. The iPhone app crashes much too often when taking or deleting a reading.  This never happened until Version 3.0.2. 2.  There is no way to easily discard a reading.  You have to save it first (a 2 step process), and then go through the 3 step process to delete it.  This is far too much work.  To make matters worse, the down arrow for Edit/Delete is so small  that I miss it half the time, thus adding even more steps. 3.  The web site could be very useful for observing trends over a longer period of time (I often need to view the trends in my heart rate over several weeks).  Alas, the web site only only shows 3 days/6 readings on a page (which is largely useless)  and each reading takes up far too much room on a page.  I would love to see all readings for the current month, prior month, etc. in a nice concise format.  I hope that 2016 will see some major upgrades.",

So far, there is no conclusion I can reach.\n\nOverall, I give the device a very good rating.  When I first showed the device to my cardiologist in May of 2015 he said it was just a toy and of no value.  Nine months later he'd turned around 180 degrees.  I don't know what happened in the mean time but he now thinks it very useful.  My GP thought it was a great device from the beginning.  All the nurses I've shown it to in cardiac rehab didn't know such a device existed and thought it was great. \nI recently required the services if an electrophysiologist.  He though the recordings I'd made before seeing him showing potential Afib/Aflutter and the recordings made post-ablation were very useful and he gave me his email address to keep him apprised of my progress.\nEven though the device is not a diagnostic tool and it records just one lead,  it is so much better to have recordings that can be seen by others instead of just showing up at the ER saying, \"I think something's wrong\"!",

        "comment": "I only bought this a few days ago and already I'm pleased.  I like how it works, how simple it is to use, how small it is (I've ordered a case for it so it won't be lost), and how I can see the results instantly.  I have an apple watch and this, I think adds additional peace of mind.\r\nHowever, two things.  1) While the app does sync with Apple Health Kit, it doesn't sync with the blood pressure readings, that I must take several times a day.  It has space for me to add the info, but I would rather it added it itself, because it already adds the EKG readings from the apple watch, so I'm confused why it doesn't with the BP.\r\n2) It requires a microphone, which is logical, so I have to turn off the podcasts or audible books I spend the most time listening to.  I'm ok with that.  What does bother me though, is that I also have to turn off my hearing aids(!!!) because they are bluetooth and sync to my phone.  That is actually unpleasant for me.  I know it's only for a minute, at the most, but still, it's something I hope that Kardia can eventually work around.  \r\nOther than those two issues, I like Kardia and will keep using it.",

For more than the basic reading you have to pay a subscription.  They pray on fear and try to get you to pay for consultations and advanced features.  Privacy statement says they can sell your data to other parties.  Needs to be less than 10 inches from your phone to get a good signal and connection.  Recently purchased it hoping for a better resolution and ease of use for readings.  I got an pulse rate warning from my watch, used the watch EKG and it showed Afib detected, I tried the Kardia, nope, you're fine.  Checked my watch EKG again, it still showed Afib.  Tried an older Omron monitor I have, it showed Afib.  Tried the Kardia again, nope, normal sine.  I have had this happen on two different occasions several days apart. The closest it came to any abnormal reading was unclassified.   If I have symptoms and it shows on 2 other devices, but not this one, then it's a piece of crap that I don't want.  Taking it back.  I would not recommend it to anyone.",

I recently purchased the KardiaMobile and had serious exhaustion issues on 1/31/22 and 2/1/22.  Told my doctor and triage nurse.  They had me come in for an EKG and to see the doctor on 2/4/22.  Everything was normal, especially since I wasn't having and issue.   My doctor ordered an Echocardiogram to ben done at the hospital on the 16th and set up to wear an extended heart monitor on the 21st.  Well on 2/10 I had another serious issue, 157 BPM according to KardiaMbile.  It faded away, it seemed.  Then on 2/11 it came on strong again so I went to the hospital emergency.  I was considered a patient who needed urgent care because their EKG showed I was in Atrial Fibrillation with BPM of 160.  My daughter originally thought on 2/10 that I was having a panic attack.  My Fir Bit Watch and my Pulse Oximeter did not show anything.  My heart rate on them was normal.  Thank you KardiaMoible.  You may have saved my life.  And I originally purchase KardiaMobile for curiosity and fun.",

        "comment": "Great product! My only concerns are a very faint Electrical noise when touching it now while doing things on my phone. I'm wondering if it's because I've dropped my phone a couple of times with it on the back. I've taken it off sense as to not damage it any further, however then I don't use it as often. I've used it on my dog by spraying his fur with alcohol, and it works! Also, I have seen numerous doctors here in Texas about it, including the cardiologist, and nobody knew it existed and they thought it was the coolest thing. They would recommend it if they knew easily how to get it at cetera. So really my only complaint after having it over a year is for someone to tell me what that electrical noise is, if it is harmful to me or the equipment, or my phone, and maybe it needs to be slightly more durable... But then again maybe it's fine. I would like instructions or way of how to do it while exercising with that maybe asking too much! Keep up the good work! Get an advertising program too! It's a good product and worth it!",

I also teach exercise physiology at Chico State, so I use it often in class. I also use it during my own exercise program.  I have several suggestions:  1. Integrate the unit into a protective case for the iPhone. My phone face cracked when I substituted the AliveCor system for an Otterbox (broke when I dropped the phone on the ground). 2. Modify the unit so it works during exercise. You could wire the phone to a bipolar lead system a person could wear during physical activity. I currently use it to check my heart rate and EKG during intense bike rides. I stop and take my EKG standing up. When I am extremely fatigued, It is sometimes difficult to get a good measurement. 3. The new interface is inconvenient. I liked the history button on the old interface. Also, the patient's name should be clearly visible on each strip.  Otherwise, I think this is a first-class device.",

Can save the file and e-mail as a PDF--great feature.",

        "comment": "The AliveCor was recommended to me by my cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic, after I was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation & atrial flutter. I have used it at least 300 time in the last 15 months. It has provided me invaluable feedback, teaching me what my symptoms translate to. I now know that what I thought was just an exhausted jittery feeling requiring 5 more cups of coffee to cure is high speed fibrillation/flutter requiring medical attention. I wish I had this years ago when these symptoms started.....I was undiagnosed for likely ten years. My cardiologists have both relied on AliveCor readings I have e-mailed them or shown them in office visits. One cardiac technician told me the AliveCor produces better results than the ECG device in their office. It has helped me recover, understand what literally ticks me off, and how to control my symptoms (I am 7 months post-ablation and doing well, finally). And it is the best cocktail party conversation starter ever....",

It has helped to confirm a condition I have been recently diagnosed with (POTS). However, you can't read anything accurately between QRS complexes, and a paid reading will only tell you if your BPM is brady, tachy, or normal/normal unknown origin -- something that anyone with 30 seconds research will already know. Plus, I've gotten a-fib and flutter readings that weren't actually a-fib or flutter. The other downside is you can't get lead 2 when you're standing up and I've never had much luck with the chest readings even though I am thin. That being said, I am SUPER glad to have this bc it is helpful and extremely convenient. Also, the human readings have never taken more than a couple of hours to come back, and most come back in minutes. I think it has a great future, especially in mobile medicine and patient health management.",

I initially secured it to the phone with the provided adhesive but that make my protective shell for the phone unusable so I pried it loose. When simply held against the back of the phone (with the silicone bumber still in place) the \"velvet\" left on the electrodes acts to keep it from slipping about, and after a couple complexes of trash I get a fine tracing.   The electrode unit has had a few troubles with the battery contact, I have had to open it up or tap it strongly a few times but it starts working again.   The sharing options have been very useful.  I actually sent a copy of a reacing labelled \"afib\" to my electrophysiologist via email attachment. He called me in and I was carfdioverted and my medications adjusted. The device was a great source of curiosity to the hospital staff (I brought it in and used it daily).  Go ahead and stretch this to make and sell a cordless 12 lead machine!",

Her cardiologist thinks she is going into a  paroxysmal afib but so far we haven't been able to get a recording of it.   She even spent a week on a portable monitor but unfortunately did not experience any episodes.  After seeing this product advertised I felt it might be worth checking out....It appeared easy to use so I ordered it.  It is about the size of a credit card and once the app was downloaded it worked easily and as advertised.  The first EKG  was taken and within 12 hours the result was received releasing the Kardia for use.  I then tried the Kardia on myself and received an instant readout of Lead I and was able to print a hard copy for my records.  I feel it will be invaluable due to its small size and ease of use in diagnosing the palpitations my wife is experiencing as it can literally go anywhere she goes.   Great product.  Thank you.",

The Samsung Galaxy 8 has been around for a long time now and yet you're still not compatible with it? How can you sell a product that's so far behind? Are customers supposed to go out and buy an old phone from some old phone website? I don't even know if I could buy an old phone just for this purpose, although I suppose I would if the old phone were cheap enough. PLEASE make it a priority to be compatible with the technologies that people are actually using, now. Not what people were using 2 years ago. That just doesn't work. You have to keep up. I'm so frustrated because I really, really do need this device. What should I do? Maybe you ought to sell the older phones at a reduced price so people can buy your device? It's a way around the problem.....\n-Stacey ... waiting and worrying",

I’m now scheduled for a stress test. I had a holster monitor for a week with results to be discussed. Now probable Amblation surgery in the very near future.\r\nThank you Kardia!!!",

It does not bother me (I cannot hear it), but if a coworker next to my room is there, she goes nuts and starts screaming at me to \"turn it off\", i.e. stop using it. Gives her instant migraines - so who knows what it is doing to others.",

But until my cardiologist got the reading we could not be sure.  I did not want to go to the ER to get an EKG. Now I can monitor my rhythm from home. An incredible invention!",

Maybe even collaborate with Spire to build a unified solution ?",

Or it starts working and then I'll have only two seconds to go, and then it stops and tells me that it was interrupted and I have to do it again - and that will happen ten times in a row (even though I didn't do anything to interrupt it).  Or it just doesn't work at all - the pads don't register my fingers as existing at all.  It's incredibly frustrating.  The other thing I'm confused about it what it's really supposed to do.  I mean, so far, it just tells me that I have \"normal sinus rhythm\", but what else?  Can't you give me any more information than that?  I requested a cardiologist's review, but never got anything back about it.  I feel like I spent an awful lot of money on something that only works some of the time and so far only tells me that I'm \"normal\" about one thing.  I thought it would do more.",

I simply click on the App and it will record an EKG of my heart. It will give you a diagnosis. You can email them to your MD directly from app. Two years ago I had several episodes of Atrial Fibrillation.  I emailed them to my cardiologist who immediately started me on a blood thinner. AFIB is very dangerous and causes strokes. This device has saved my life. Most people who have strokes do not know they have AFIB. Having the EKG evidence not only got me on the blood thinners, but I am being treated at the Cleveland Clinic for a surgery to eliminate the AFIB. It is amazing that I caught the AFIB. None of my holter monitors had found it. Now I am on a path at one of the finest heart hospitals in the world. Thank you for inventing this. I have recommended it to so many friends.",

The technology of this device is incredible.  AliveCor could not say if it was compatible with my LG model G7 ThinQ phone because they had not tested the device with that specific phone.  Regardless, I purchased the device and it is compatible with my phone as well as with my wife's IPhone.  The device is easy to set up, and fast and easy to operate.  The results compare favorably with results from EKG in cardiologist office.  Most of my readings  are indicated to be Possible AFib, with occasional Unclassified readings.  Readings for my wife, who does not have any known heart issues, are indicated to be Normal.  I email the charts to my cardiologist on a weekly basis.  I have a friend who has AFib, and has used this device for a long time.",

When I awoke the next morning, my results had been returned and I was ready to record as needed. \n\nI had a follow up appt with my heart PA on 7-26-16 and she was impressed with its ease of use and its accuracy.  (Unfortunately, I have yet to get their code so I can send an EKG to my heart doctor.) On 7-28-16 evening, it caught an A Fib episode (209 bpm) with a day's worth of 'unclassified' recordings before this episode.  \n\nI am trying hard not to become obsessed with my heart issues and go about my day as usual.  But, knowing we can catch an episode and perhaps pinpoint a specific area for the upcoming 'mapping' ablation is very comforting.  I have had no problems with recording or the device saving the recordings.  It has worked as advertised and then some.  Congrats on a great product!",

I see my doctor regularly but between visits I attempt to understand and optimize my workouts, rest & diet in order to minimize my A-Fib episodes.  I have made significant progress while learning.  I would like to see AliveCor's use and information expanded through the development or integration of other devices/applications.  Currently, I use Polar Beat with a Polar H7 bluetooth HR monitor for my workouts.  I wear a Fitbit HR to measure my sleep and daily activity.  I use Lose It! to track my diet/nutrition and finally when I am out of rhythm, I use Pill Monitor to track my medication.  Fitbit, Lose It! and Polar Beat integrate some of each others information which I find useful.  As an example, it would be great if AliveCor could read & utilize Polar's H7 bluetooth heart rate monitor strap during workouts. Keep up the good work!",

        "comment": "I began having heart palpitations, wore a monitor, was recommended to see a cardiologist who didn't think there was a problem. My husband got me a Kardia and suddenly I was able to record an episode myself. I was able to record my pulse increase to 220 bpm and see the irregularities as my rhythm changed from tachycardia to possible atrial fibrillation. After a trip to the emergency room my doctor decided that I did have atrial fibrillation and ordered a stress test. She has been able to adjust medication because I have documentation. I went to the office for a 12 lead ekg Friday morning which was fine, then had a 5 hour episode that evening with possible atrial fibrillation and tachycardia. I was able to see that the pulse stayed at 120-122 bpm most of the time with an occasional rise to 136 and bpm. The peace of mind this small device gives me is worth every dime. I am seriously considering upgrading to the 6 lead Kardia.",

The only thing keeping from rating 5 stars is that the finger electrodes tend to be finicky about picking up.  Customer service seems good, as my order was processed quickly, and I received my unit in just a few days.",

However, if the episodes are short, they may be gone by the time you get your phone and the monitor set up to get a recording.  Best for picking up atrial fibrillation episodes which last for a few minutes or more.",

For example if you have a heart flutter or palpitation your phone might not be immediately accessible. When this occurs you do not capture the rhythm you needed or wanted. I think it should be available on a watch or have a chest band to get the information immediately.",

        "comment": "When I was diagnosed with A-Fib in November for 2015,  I did a lot of research, determined to \"cure\" my A-Fib, without surgery.  I bought my Kardia and methodically tracked my readings.  As I wasn't in persistent A-Fib or having severe symptoms, it wasn't always easy for me to know if I was in or out of NSR.  This made it very difficult for me to determine the things (work stress, diet, physical activity, etc..) that were triggering my A-Fib.  Kardia took the guess work out of it.  Ultimately, I primarily use my Kardia to verify that I am in \"possible A-Fib,\" when I don't feel \"right.\"  Kardia has been a great tool for me to learn/verify my symptoms, and to share real world data with my EP.  \n\nNew use for my Kardia:  A few days ago I had a catheter ablation, all went well.  Today I used my Kardia for my first post-ablation reading...so happy to see the word \"Normal.\"  I look forward to tracking many more \"Normal\" readings.. :)",

Ok - that's just how it went for me. I didn't want to find out I had heart disease, and had to grow up. But, I'm in health care, so it was easier to read about my disease.\nThis device is i bit small/unstably on your stomach, and you must have moist fingers or the device never finds \"baseline\". The mfg must be nuts not giving you some way to steady your fingers, phone and device, and moist fingers.  I'm in the trade, so patient. Woe be new users. But, a thick book, salt water presoaked fingers, and the will to learn some basics. Finally, sending this to an on line cardio seems nuts except AFIB or multiple PVCs, which you need to get to an ER. This requires learning IMHO. And DON'T  take \"your\" EKG.  IMHO. You'll look like an idiot.",

Apparently, KardiaMobile uses ultrasonic waves to communicate with the smartphone through the smartphone's microphone. So, I downloaded the SoniControl app from the Android play store and ran the AliveCor app, WHILE the SoniControl firewall was running at the same time. What that firewall does is, it apparently stops Android from blocking those signals. New versions of Android seem to block ultrasonic signals by default. Perfect little device otherwise. \r\n\r\nJust be aware of privacy and security issues with using SoniControl. I recommend that you switch the firewall off, when you are not running the AliveCor app.\r\n\r\nMy husband has frequent PVCs / bigemeny and it gives us a piece of mind!!!\r\n\r\nVery easy to use, once the phone compatibility issue got resolved.

Since purchasing the monitor last June, 2015, I have not had an AFib episode.  I still plan to monitor my heart daily and maybe someday log an AFib episode to see what my heart is actually doing.    I haven't experimented with any ECG position other than my fingers on the electrodes.  Maybe someday I will try the other connection methods.  The only problem I've had with the monitor is extraneous signal interference.  For example, I just returned from a three week cruise and couldn't use the ECG monitor because of the ships interference.  It might not be possible to provide a more stable connection from the ECG to the phone app.  If you can, that would be appreciated.  I don't do any symptom logging because I never have any symptoms aside from the irregular rhythm of my heart.",

It does fit the phone without the sensor in place.\n\nIt looks like an engineer just cut two square holes in a standard jacket and never tried it out.\n\nJohn",

I ripped it off my phone after a month because it made it bulky, hard to put into my pockets.  I also don't have afib and didn't like the false reads. Overall very useless.",

The rhythm strip shown is not tachycardia. Surely if you are selling a medical device that interprets heart rate and rhythm, your ad team should be comprised of people who know basic cardiac rhythms. I would not trust this device for that reason.",

The Kardia Mobile has saved me and my wife a lot of worry, and the expense of unnecessary trips to the ER to confirm my suspicions that my heart flutter was only minor. Very affordable peace of mind for those with episodes of heart flutter, or past episodes of A-Fib that were successfully restored to normal heart rhythm. The Carry Pod is an inexpensive accessory that looks like part of your key chain and makes it even easier to have the Kardia Mobile with you at all times. The Kardia Mobile device will report A-Fib if I have it so I can get immediate medical care.  It also provides me with an EKG that can be emailed to my doctor for reference.  My doctor reminded me to get immediate medical care for severe or persistent flutters, but confirmed that the EKG's I sent to her via email did not show any serious palpitations.",

I did a baseline and it was a Regular sinus rhythm at rate of 58 which is normal for me. . One Saturday night ( so a weekend) I flipped into the weird arrhythmia and quickly got an EKG and it was A-Fib at rapid capture rate of 132 to 150. It lasted 5 hours. I called snd sent both normal and abnormal EKGs to my cardiologist on Monday morning and he put me on a blood thinner to prevent stroke until I could see him in 3 weeks ( which was totally fine and good care).

Having to take my phone case off and then put it back on to use the ECG was getting annoying and so this is why I stopped.  Wish there could be a way to not remove my case -- I would probably not have stopped recording.",

This two finger analyzer is not it.  8 time out of 10 it comes back as “interference” unable to read, even though you are sitting quietly at your kitchen table.  The “Need Help” position is not helpful.  I am returning mine.  I need something that actually works.",

Didn't want to use the sticky tape that came with it b/c I was worried about its strength and getting it off if I needed too. After maybe a year I looked down and my unit was gone. I got another one. I did not want to order the one with the iphone case because I like the case I have. I was thinking about other ideas to suggest: maybe a container that hold the device and clips on to my keyring? or could be hung on my purse or belt?  I'm afrasd to stick it on my phone now. I probably bumped my phone and it fell off. Not sure what happened. I have a clip on my phone which I attaches to my clothes and so I cannot put it on my phone directly. It barely fits as it is but the device fits accross the end of the phone. Just a thought. Thanks.",

No doubt tens of thousands by now, and was excited about the device when I found out about it when I myself thought I had A fib.  I have had 2 different Alive Cor monitors.  The first one I bought produced a high quality tracing.  Unfortunately it quit working after only a couple of weeks.  I was sent a replacement monitor.  That one doesn't produce a tracing that is of sufficient quality to determine the rhythm.  I can see QRS complexes and I can tell if the rhythm is regular.  But P waves can almost never be seen (even when I know I am in sinus rhythm).  Very disappointing.  I was hoping to be able to recommend the device for my patients.  I hope the reliability of the device can be improved because if it could it could help a lot of people.",

        "comment": "As a person recently diagnosed with atrial fibrillation that does not show through rapid heart beats, I've found the Kardia Mobile unit to be extremely valuable in letting me know exactly what my condition is at any moment.  It's an extremely easy unit to use, and I like the fact it keeps record of my condition when used.  I highly recommend it for anyone diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, as did my cardiologist.",

The only change I would make is adding the ability to write something about symptoms/activities in addition to using what is offered.   Also I have a case for my iPhone 5 but there isn't a case for the iPhone 6s.  I bought what looks like a stick on addition which ruins the look of the phone and provides no protection for the phone.  I recommended to customer service that selling rubberized cases would provide some cushioning for a phone but was told that the cases aren't advertised to protect the phone. No kidding! But isn't it a good idea? The idea is that you have the capability to check heart rate anytime you have your phone with you so doesn't it make sense to protect this expensive device and make it look good, or at least decent?",

Helped us to keep an accurate  record of what was going on in the months following the ablation. Worked great. Can't beat this set up, particularly at the price. Highly recommend it.  The ablation, also fixed the problem. While no walk in the park, it did the trick in my case (at least thus far). I highly recommend that also!",

        "comment": "I was having panic attacks which I thought was a heart problem. Had full tests done at my Cardiologist including wearing a very high tech new heart monitor/patch for a month. We were not able to capture my episodes during the monitoring because I didn’t have one during that time. Cardiologist gave me all clear and said my heart was fine. I wasn’t convinced. It just didn’t feel right. So I bought the Kardia Mobile device just to give myself peace of mind. I captured many “episodes” on my device that read as AFib. I sent the reports to the Kardia Mobile cardiologist who confirmed I was having AFib. I went back to my cardiologist who confirmed I have AFib and I am now being treated for it. Although I was having panic attacks I was also having Afib episodes and this device confirmed my suspensions which led me to proper care which I feel possibly saved me from a stroke or worse.",

        "comment": "I purchased the KardiaMobile two weeks ago.  I have persistent AFib most of the time, with occasional periods when I am out of AFib, although I am unable to detect when in AFib. The technology of this device is incredible.  AliveCor could not say if it was compatible with my LG model G7 ThinQ phone because they had not tested the device with that specific phone.  Regardless, I purchased the device and it is compatible with my phone as well as with my wife's IPhone.  The device is easy to set up, and fast and easy to operate.  The results compare favorably with results from EKG in cardiologist office.  Most of my readings  are indicated to be Possible AFib, with occasional Unclassified readings.  Readings for my wife, who does not have any known heart issues, are indicated to be Normal.  I email the charts to my cardiologist on a weekly basis.",

I have since been treated medically and later surgically and have been in normal sinus rhythm ever since. I run a strip once each week just to document my results. I have recommended it to several friends and even my cardiologist now recommends it to patients. A wonderful invention.",

        "comment": "I use the Alivecor device on my son's chest as opposed to using it on the hands. I bought it when he was 11 months old and have had it for two years. We've been able to send PDFs to our doctor and it has saved us a few trips to the ER, so it paid itself off quickly. Unfortunately it's not calibrated for children, so the alerts for Afib etc don't apply to my son, but it still gives accurate enough readings for whether or not he's having tachycardia (which I, as a person who is uneducated on reading EKGs, base my judgements only on heart rate). Our doctor is careful to remind me that the alerts are not accurate and I shouldn't put too much stock in what this says.  I'm proud to say I've only called the doctor in an unneeded panic once.   I like to use it as a log of events--I take notes on the EKGs when he's sick or looking pale. I recommend it!",

        "comment": "The EKG gives a good waveform and has built in filters to remove noise, flip the signal if you have the device upside-down and detect atrial fibrillation. I like how you can turn the smoothing off and that you can email a PDF of the printout.  The ability to have a technician or a doctor interpret the data for a reasonable price is useful for users without formal medical training.  My main complaint is that customers cannot email a CSV file with the actual data from the EKG, as it would be a smaller file than an image and would allow customers to plot the data themselves if they wanted to.  I also wish the product came with a carrying case to protect it.  Another useful optional accessory would be wires with alligator clips to attach electrodes, which may make it easier to remain still while using the device and yield more-accurate information.",

More than 90% of my readings were put in que and never resolved. hat experience reduced my willingness to use the App.  It seems to be working better now.  Only 1 in 4 or 5 readings have not produced a reading.  The App is not too difficult to use, but requires that one take time to figure out - it is not widely intuitive.  For me, that's somewhat of a problem.",

        "comment": "The system does work.  The phone app was easy to setup.  Wet finger tips starts the recording and it records for 30 secs.  You can save the recording and also send to your doctor if you want and print out s hard copy.  It only diagnoses three things, AFIB, tachycardia, bradycardia and also normal.  The finger tip pad is very sensitive.  The slightest movement will cause the recording to stop or give a few flaky waves.  If it stops you can start it over.  This is not the same as a multi lead EKG but it is a way to monitor between dr visits.  It is also not a substitute for a Cardiologist.  I am sure it is not 100% accurate but it does seem to be helpful.  I have been to the cardiologist yet to compare to their EKG machine, but I will on my next visit.  I will also show my hard copies to the dr. also.  I have been using this for about 4 weeks now.",

        "comment": "The AliveCor app works pretty well. But a few comments. 1. Needs a battery voltage monitor from within the app. My unit stopped reading and only after checking the coin battery with a voltmeter was I able to know I needed a new battery. Worked fine after that. 2. Adjustable sensitivity? My fingers sometimes do not give a good connection. Bigger pads? (I have big hands.) 3. WiFi interference. The app should stop and say there is too much interference  to get a reading. Like it does if your phone is being recharged.  Saying that I still think the app is great. We are gone for 4 months in the winter and I asked my cardiologist about afib returning, after conversion.  He said it depends on the degree of afib. I've lived with irregular heartbeats for some time but also experienced doubled pulse rate. He said when in doubt just send him an AliveCor reading.",

Over time I could see his heart rate becoming more erratic and even stopping for a minute after he climbed his stairs to his room.  This past month he started getting dizzy spells and collapsing at his dentist's office and at his dermatologist's surgical room.  At first I thought it was due to anxiety but four days ago he was dizzy and fatigued when he woke up in the morning.  His KardiaMobile show a very rapid prolonged heartbeat that was getting faster and faster so I called 911.  Turns out he has atrial fibrillation, ventricle dysfunction, and severe stenosis of the aortic valve.  I strongly believe the KardiaMobile device saved his life.  Now he can still look forward to his 100th birthday!",

The work around I am using is:turn off Bluetooth wile using the Kardia app and be sure to point the little hole on the side of the sensor toward the microphone on the I-Pad.  The sensor uses a 19KHz audio carrier to communicate to the I-Pad and apparently the electronics is sensitive to the 2.4GHz Bluetooth signal.",

Without this device's warning and a few other prods I probably wouldn't have been able to get her to go to the emergency.  This could literally be a life saver for somebody.\nIf you have a loved one with heart related issues you can probably benefit from having a KardiaMobile.",

It is an annoying low heart rate form that does not impact my daily activities but tracking it is essential to my understanding it and trying to control it.  The AliveCor ECG readings and journal are invaluable in assisting me in this effort.  I record at onset and again when returned to normal sinus rhythm and make use of the data to help both me and my physician manage my condition.",

We have outfitted our Advanced Life Support providers with AliveCor Mobile ECG units for their personal devices.  In the time that it takes to palpate a pulse and assess the patients orientation to person, place and time, we now have a Lead I ECG that we can email to Medical Control.  In addition to the obvious benefits of early baseline ECG in the vital signs, the patients are very impressed.",

His heart malfunctions have also been subtle so I am often concerned when he describes symptoms to me that sound cardiac related.  Now I can at least run a single-lead ECG with my AliveCor device and forward it to his primary care physician at the VA.  It gives me a feeling I am doing something proactive rather than waiting around for worst case scenario.",

        "comment": "I've been using the Kardia EKG device and app since the original model. I record my EKG every morning to track my resting heart rate and have a 'before' trace available in case I go into a-fib. I think it's a great, in some ways revolutionary, medical device. Highly recommended.\n\nThere is one thing with the app that annoys me. It won't let you record an EKG with NFC on, so every time you go to record an EKG, you have to go into your settings and turn NFC off, then when done recording, go back into settings yet again and turn NFC off.  Like more and more users, I use Google Pay almost daily, which requires NFC. So, every day I have to go through several extra steps to turn NFC off and on. It would be great if the app turned NFC off and back on for you, automatically, as controlled by a Kardia settings button.",

The wider/flatter contacts are much easier for most people to use (especially if they have relatively dry and wrinkled skin like my mom).  However, the new case for the iPhone 6 is a problem.  The edges are too hard and were the cause of a shattered crystal twice.  I would suggest getting the device and then attaching it to a third-party case or cutting out one of the leather cases to fit it inside.",

I have atrial tachycardia and atrial fibrillation, neither of these have been caught by the app or the cardiologists reading the clips.",

        "comment": "I am a retired anesthesiologist. I had been aware of occasional \"skipped beats\" for some time, which were never caught on ECG in the doctor's office. When I heard of AliveCOR, I hoped it would enable me to \"be there when it happened\" and record whatever was going on.\r\n\r\nThat is EXACTLY what it did for me. First, occasional atrial ectopy; later, variable P-wave morphology, occasional dropped beats and short runs of tachycardia. Eventually, 2 bouts of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.\r\n\r\nIronically, on the basis of these findings that *I* recorded, my cardiologist arranged for a 30-day telemetered recording _ which did NOT happen to catch any AFib. But on the basis of the AliveCOR tracings, I was started on apixaban anticoagulant.\r\n\r\nAbsent my AliveCOR recordings, we would still be \"up in the air\" about this diagnosis.",

My heart beat was acting up the other day, and I immediately went to the KardiaMobile to measure my EKG to send to my cardiologist, and it kept not reading my heartbeat. It said there was no signal, however, the device was right next to my phone, not near any phone charger or anything (apparently that affects the signal). It has happened a few times. There also is nothing to protect the device. There is a clip that sticks to your phone, but there is no hard case around it to protect it. So if it is bouncing around in my purse, or if I lay my phone down, it is going to wear out the device. The case that clips to your keys is also not a hard case, so if it is crushed by someone putting something on my keys when I'm not looking, it'll damage the device.",

Use mine a couple of times a week or when I sense an unusual heart beat. I tell all my friends and relatives to monitor their heart health with their doctors on a regular basis, because you never know what is going on inside your body until it's too late sometimes. After all I had my first heart attack when I was only 38 and yes it took me by surprise .

I don't use it every day just when I think I'm having an AFIB episode which is about every three to four months on average.  It varies.  The only thing I don't like about it is that it is very sensitive to electrical interference (like my fridge), so I would have to take it somewhere else.",

By loading the client software on multiple phones, you can easily have additional family members get their EKG readings. There is an option for cloud storage, but I found the price not worth the price. I use the device a couple times a week and have been very pleased with the purchase.",

So monitoring them with AliveCor and sending the info to my cardiologist helps with deciding if any treatment is necessary. It also puts my husband's mind at ease, knowing there is a way to get information to the doctor when it happens.  If you go to the emergency room or make a doctor's appointment you are already better and there are no symptoms for them to monitor or test. Thanks",

It is easy to use and the information is beneficial for those who have a history of atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation.  Occasionally, the AliveCor will fail to save the first reading of the day, but it usually will save the next reading taken and it is not  big issue with the unit.  Great value for money and an excellent way to monitor your heart health.",

It is great to be able to get a rhythm strip instantly, anytime, anywhere from my patient and they can send it to me instantly.

Now, I can just run a strip and send it to my doctor, and I can respond accordingly.  If it is nothing, I can go back to whatever I was doing, but if it is urgent, I can go straight to the E.R.

Normal. I wasn't feeling bad or in pain, just a little sweat. I tried it 10 more times before it convinced me to go to the Emergency room, they hooked me up to the professional unit and the doctor walked in and said yup I that I was full blown afib, and asked me what symptoms I was having, sweaty And the kardia mobile.

However, when my wife tried it, it showed a EKG that was almost completely flat, with just a little blip where there was probably a VPB.  Since this would not show an accurate, readable EKG for her, it was worthless for us so we returned the unit.\n\nWe should mention that we were not attempting to view EKG for the the conditions that the unit is specified to diagnose, like A-Fib.  It's hard to say whether would recommend the unit since it may work very well for the conditions it specifies, but it didn't work for us.",

        "comment": "Your programmers took the easy way out in designing the ECG display.  Instead of imitating the familiar format of traditional ECG devices (where the pen is fixed and the paper scrolls) they made the \"pen\" move across the screen and \"jump\" back to the left when it reaches the right edge.  This is disconcerting and really unnecessary.  It should be fixed a.s.a.p.  The \"delete\" option is unnecessarily hard to find. It should be more clearly marked.  You should provide instructions for how to best remove the \"sticky stuff\" from the back of the device for users who don't want to attach it to their phone.  You should contact Starkey and work out the incompatibility between your software and theirs. While my Starkey hearing aids are active, your app does not \"hear\" your 3rd generation device.",

I carry the Alive Cor with me in my travels along with the various meds I take, and when I'm uncertain about my pulse, I use it.  It's very easy to use and certainly provides excellent rhythm information.  However, p wave detection is only intermittent (even when I'm in sinus rhythm), so it's of little help, even when I use it with a small tube of electrode paste that I also carry.  Non-the-less, It's a valuable accessory and worth the cost.",

        "comment": "When you install the app, it requests permission to use the microphone in your tablet/phone.  I believe the link is audio.  My EKG monitor worked out of the box.  As signal strength weakened, I replaced the cr2016 battery.  Signal strength was strong but ALL recordings were \"unreadable\".  I found that with a new  battery and strong signal, the monitor HAD to be a minimum of eighteen inches away from the tablet/phone.  Then it worked fine again.  Understand that this is the less expensive model, that works with two finger contacts.  The other model includes a bottom contact for your left knee  in addition to the two finger contacts.  It gives more sophisticated readings.  Recordings are saved to your tablet/phone OR you can buy a  service that will upload readings to your doctor or cloud.",

        "comment": "Sending my ECG directly to my doctor enables me to be less anxious when my heart rate varies. It makes me more confident and keeps me  from running to the doctor or urgent care center.  When I talk to my doctor he can easily give me advise over the telephone of how to tweek my meds. He can then see how the subsequent change is or is not working.  It was frustrating to me when the mobile device did not work when I was on vacation and then when the battery went. It was too complicated for me to change so I was sent a new case.  It is also helpful since I live in two different states and can share the results easily with both doctors.  I am still amazed that my readings can be sent wirelessly. This is a positive use of technology. I hope I can continue to use it after the 6 month study ends.",

        "comment": "I bought my Kardia mobile two years ago after my first incident of atrial flutter. It gave me great peace of mind while I maintained normal rhythm. Then when I experienced a second episode of flutter, my mobile confirmed it and I was able to provide detailed info to my cardiologist. After a successful ablation to correct my flutter, I again relied on my Kardi mobile for peace of mind. But now all I get are unreadable results - interference when I'm in a silent room with no electronics nearby, crazy looking tracing, and constant \"did Walter record this?\" I find it coincidental that I also CONSTANTLY get asked to upgrade. NO! I don't need that. I just want the device I bought to work properly. It may be time to get a smart watch with built in ecg because Kardia mobile is clearly not the answer.",

I was told to set the interference check and after that I was getting better results. I seem to notice however that if my heart rate is below 50/min that I likely will not get an evaluation. Sometimes the medication I am on lowers my heart rate into the 40's. My cardiologist seemed to be impressed when I showed him the readings. He ask me to record my EKG results with a blood pressure reading on the chart he gave me. Also, I think I get a better reading with only lightly touching the sensors. I think that the doctors could use the results, but they are not set up to automatically receive the records and filter the information to the patient's record yet.",

The upper right hand corner is cracked a bit and sometimes catches in my pocket. I hope that does not become a problem.

My doctor stated my fibrillation was dangerous, so we did an ablation, now my heart beat is so slow they worry I won't wake up (28bpm resting). This device helps me to more accurately see when the heart is off or simply slow. The majority of heart rate monitors out there today, unless you buy a medical grade 12 lead EKG machine, cannot come close to the accuracy and information this device can provide. Especially in mobile form, this 30 second EKG reader is a unique and potent tool for understanding your QRS signature and the manner your heart responds when you are out living your life.",

Reason we did not like it is if/when someone is having an episode of pains, if you don't have this unit right by your side and your phone right there it is of no use. It is imperative to get a reading right away. Plus the unit has to be in a particular position with the phone for it to work correctly. If they could get it to work using other than Infrared then it might be worth 5 stars to us.",

This not only gives peace of mind; is it Afib or benign arrhythmia, it also means you're not attached to a cardiac monitor or an ILR to document what you feel.  I wish I had this 6 years ago when a cardiologist dismissed my vital signs, symptoms for 'anxiety or menopause'.  Thank you!  Change the settings to 2 minutes so you clinician has a better read.  Skip the BFx - it is confusing.  Add the ability to save or not save instead of going back to delete.  A flat monthly rate for x number of readings by tech and/or cardiologist in addition to a per EKG price.  Would to show 'benign arrhythmia' and 'tachycardia' in addition to 'NSR' and 'AFib'.",

Just one important suggestion, if you have dry fingers and hands like me, I strongly recommend wiping them with a baby wipe prior to trying to take a reading!  When I first purchase the Kardia and tried to get a reading, I would get either no reading or it would switch between no reading and a weak reading.

This device is no substitute for see your doctor, but it does allow for a quick self-check after exercising or more strenuous outside work. It works with my Android phone and the app that I downloaded. It never fails to communicate with my phone and the app. I assumed that my physician would disregard the records-- but actually he looks at the records on my phone and old me to keep using it. (I am not saying he endorsed it, but he said he would look again at my next appointment)",

        "comment": "I bought my Kardia EKG after learning of it from my cardiologist. Two months later, it documented a recurrence of my hereditary atrial fibrillation. As a physician, I knew the tracing showed a fib, but I still had it read by Kardia's board-certified cardiologist on call. The cardiologist had 24 hours to read it, but mine was interpreted in about 24 minutes. I obtained two other EKGs that evening. One documented a rapid ventricular response, which fortunately did not last long.  The third EKG documented a return to normal sinus rhythm after the medications took effect.  Based on this documentation, my cardiologist changed my medications and I have changed my lifestyle. I recommend this device to my own patients with episodic atrial fibrillation.",

        "comment": "Kardia is easy to use, convenient and was priced afforably. It allows me to record and save my EKGs so that I can show my doctor if necessary.  It is small so handling it is not a problem.  It was recommended to me by my cardiologist as a way for me to check my vitals. You can add additional items to your Kardia if you choose and interact with a knowledgeable person if you need to. As someone who was most likely misdiagnosed years ago it has given me the peace of mind to get off of my medication and be able to administer an EKG at any time.",

It does what it's supposed to do, and it was not too expensive for the task.

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Without buying the extra add-ons (with monthly charges), this device is much less useful than I thought it would be. It starts off each reading with wildly fluctuating markings each time I use it only to declare “normal sinus rhythm” even when I can FEEL my heart skipping beats. And it can’t detect a heart attack—which is probably 90% of the reason most people buy it in the first place. Read the fine print before you buy. What they tout in advertisements you only get at considerable additional cost so the $79.00 price quote is misleading.",

It will detect some types of arrhythmia for the purchase price, but to get access to more types you need to pay a subscription.  Could you imagine a doctor telling you that they've listened to your heart and will tell you part of their assessment, but to get their entire assessment you'll have to pay an additional monthly subscription?  Unbelievable!  Capitalism without compassion, I guess.  I think that's lame!",

The wave forms with the enhanced filter is very smooth and the morphology is very consistent between individual complexes. Some times I get electrical interference, but interestingly if I open up the battery compartment and reposition the battery, it seems to go away. I would certainly recommend this to any one who would like to check their cardiac rhythm or PAcs vs PVCs etc, but would not recommend this  to diagnose heart blocks, MAT,u waves etc.",

After a little trial and error, it worked great.I am using it with an IPhone 5s. I have been fighting Afib and Flutter for several years. I have had 12 cardiversion and 2 ablations, with a 3rd ablation in the works. I have shared my use of this device with several of my heart doctors and several of the staff in the Cath Lab. When needed I send results to my email, then print them off for doctor visits. Thanks for the great tool.",

Running water in kitchen or hissing sounds from industrial HVAC systems make obtaining readings difficult. Ambient sounds affect pattern. Positioning Kardia device with respect to microphone may render reading inverted. Just flip it around 180 degrees to fix. But I love having this device and I use it all the time especially when my heart develops symptoms. It’s been very accurate with doctor visit EKG comparisons.",

Only real \"downside\" to this is it does need to be in close proximity to the phone for detection and NFC must be turned off. \n\nIt does have a monthly for a free \"diagnosis\" of EKG results once every 90 days. But if you're just looking to monitor your own results and send them on to your doctor, it allows for a PDF to be saved to the phone and forwarded on. \n\nIt even allows for guest usage so it doesn't add to your personal stored results.",

Occasionally it can't record an ECG due to interference - I've never been able to identify the source of said interference.  My cardiologist was pleased with the reports - although the backup cardiologist at the VA was simply confused by the monthly report.",

If your only diagnosis is atrial fibrillation and you own an iPad or iPhone, then you really should have this. My only reservation is that the signal is just not clear and steady enough for several other diagnoses. There are many other electrical problems that can affect the heart, but this device is not much help with them. Still, it has its place. I use it for routine monitoring at least once a week, and I am very glad to have it. When used together with an inexpensive blood pressure cuff, it can give you peace of mind when you are doing well, and warnings to head to the ER when you are not. Just remember that it cannot possibly replace a full EKG.",

It's not something to rely on out, but it does give peace of mind for certain health conditions.

Download the app, connect with bluetooth, and place both left and right hand middle nad index fingers on the lead and you can watch your heart rate cardiogram. There is a subscription portion to this which allows you to detech othr heart issues, but I think the basic would be good enough for most people. And if you're really worried about your heart, I would pay for the subscription. Allows you to PDF your EKG to send to your doctor which I think can be useful. You don't need an apple watch to do EKG for your heart, This one does it better and only $70 when I purchased it. 5 stars if it came with premium subecript free for at least a couple of months.",

I hold it and it initializes but then they hold it and nothing. back and forth as I coach them \"Not so tight\" or \"Tighter\" and clean or moisten the contacts.

The patient was not hooked up to a monitor. I turned on my AliveCor and saw that the patient was in VTach and shocked the patient as soon as defibrillation was available. Patient survived!\nIt is also a piece of mind. When a teenager fainted in a hot venue, I knew it was a simple feint from standing in the heat, but AliveCor was able to give the parent piece of mind that her daughters heart was fine!!\nI love this product!",

A friend, who also happens to be an Electro Cardiologist, suggested your product just to monitor my condition. He thought I might be surprised with what I found with a closer daily/hourly monitoring... After 2 months AliveCor monitoring the results indicated I might want to consider options other than just treating my condition with pharmaceuticals. This product was an integral part of the decision making process to opt in for a successful Catheter Ablation.",

Just need to make sure you are not touching anything electrical or battery operated when taking a reading as it's so sensitive it will pick those things up and get confused. Before I would listen with a stethoscope and try to see if I was in Rhythm or worrying about my heart now I can take a measurement and know where I'm at to keep myself healthy. 100 stars",

Began use it in teaching clinics for prompt feedback to students, and then became especially helpful to me due to substantial time spent in remove areas. I can now review EKG to monitor any symptoms for myself as well.  New changes in your program with warnings and regularity of rhythm seem useful, but I do keep getting AF warnings in tracings that cardiologists say is not AF.  Further development of that protocol appears to be needed (unless I need another cardiologis,t which I doubt?)",

The whole time before the procedure I wanted to see what it looked like but had no was of checking at home. After the cardio version I wanted to be able to check frequently if the problem returned.  Kardia Mobile was the answer.  I can now pull out the device and within 30 seconds check if my heart is in afib or not.  Super easy to use and I can upload of PDF of my session to my phone or email it to my computer.  I think this will be a real life savor!",

Unfortunately, when I needed it most, either for myself or out in the field when working with patients, the device failed to pair with my iPhone 6s. Both myself and others attempted to rectify the problem: we moved right next to the phone, we cleaned the device, we rebooted the phone, all without success. A few minutes later it would then connect, only to fail to do so moments thereafter. I had hoped that this device could prove clinically valuable. Thus far it is unreliable.",

It just isn't as exciting as she thought it would be, but that is not the device's fault.  It's basic functionality could be helpful should you believe you are experiencing something unusual with your heart.  I suppose you could also test yourself routinely and make note of changes in your health daily or weekly.  This is a good item if you are interested in knowing some basic information about your heart.",

The physician used my AliveCor to help diagnose a heart irregularity in one of the children in the orphanage! Wow, technology is great! Thank you dedicated staff of AliveCor!",

I had a stress test and wore a heart monitor for weeks at a time but could never capture an \"event.\"  With AliveCor I had the ability to take an ECG whenever I felt anything unusual.  After only two readings I had a conclusive diagnosis of paroxysmal a-fib from my doctor.  Now I use it to track my a-fib events and discuss treatment options with my doctor.  This is an example of a new technology that is easy to use and incredibly valuable.",

While eating breakfast with a good friend, he described feeling slightly dizzy and explained a few recent episodes.  His pulse was a tachy and irregular.  The AliveCor worked flawlessly in revealing uncontrolled A-fib. I sent the EKG to my computer, printed, gave him some Asprin and drove him straight to the ER.  I now keep my AliveCor available at all times, but use it unattached with an iPhone 6S. What an awesome product! Thanks.",

AliveCor should warn clients if PVCs are over 20% with the same message it gives for AFib so it can be monitored the same way.  I've had two cardiac ablation for AFib and rely on AliveCor to monitor when I do not feel well and document for my cardiologist.  Saves multiple trips to the doctor.  Would greatly appreciate the above mentioned improvement to the system.",

I am in healthcare and to me the rhythms seem very accurate. I wouldn't hesitate telling someone to get this if they are ever concerned about the heart rhythm.  One caveat is that if you want to know if you have any other abnormal rhythm, you will need to pay for a premium service. To me, I only needed to know if I am having a-fib or not and that is a free service that comes with the device.",

You have to take your recordings into your doctor to be read.  So it is useless as a real time device.  If you are in a-fib and your heart rate is over 50 bpm, it will analyze the recording (but or course, you will already know you are in a-fib).\n\nIn short:  If you have a slow resting heart rate, this product is not for you.",

        "comment": "I am a physician and recently converted to atrial flutter. I spoke with a tech at AliveCore. The EKG cannot discern flutter from normal sinus rhythm but will pick up fibrillation. I am satisfied with that honest answer and purchased the device for post atrial flutter to NSR( normal sinus rhythm) and documenting it. It's worth the $ and peace of mind and I am impressed that the techs are available 7 days a week. I would recommend googling a normal EKG and looking at atrial flutter/fibrillation and the difference between the two, for your own edification.It's not a perfect EKG but is always at your finger tips, if you'll excuse the play on words.It seems a lot of my friends have discovered this great technology.

I did not want to bother with a formal holter monitor, so I showed it to my Cardiologist and he was impressed.  Later in the month, my afib really went to on tear and all runs were captured on my AliveCor device.  Faxed the strips to my Cardiologist and on meds and now much better.  Speaking from experience, as I am a Board Certified Emergency Physician, it really helped me out.",

Easy to carry at all times in a pocket or billfold without a hard case, not as easy with one but still fits in a bag no problem. Getting a strong signal can sometimes be wonky, which would not be fun during an episode of erratic heart rate, but it will still get a good reading even on a weak signal. Not sure you need the $9.99 monthly subscription, but at this point I’m keeping it.",

One way to make the experience even better, would be to offer some videos that explain beats fluctuation and why sometimes the reading is \"unrecognizable\".

If normal,  details are not needed in a mass screening as patients may need to use it each time they came in. If there is an abnormality an alert could be made by the phone and it would ask for name and details for follow up by staff.",

Plus my phone's microphone wasn't able to pick up the noise the device creates while on the back of the phone.  I would have to take the device and place it at the bottom of the phone.  The interface was good.  After a few times using the device it recognized my EKG and would notify me when my wife would use it that it didn't think I was the one using the device.  I also wasn't sure about having to pay a subscription on top of paying so much for the device.",

        "comment": "After being diagnosed with both AFib and Flutter, I wanted to be able to monitor the state of my heart without having an office visit for their ECG. Had a flutter procedure which solved that problem and last year, pulmonary vein ablation which also was a success. I sent ecg graphs from my Alivecor from my iPhone 5 to my Doctor, before and after the procedure. He was very positive about having this info without taking office time. After several months of weakly to monthly readings, I am now off of Afib and warfarin and obviously pleased to be able to watch my progress in real time and at home!!",

I used it for a few days, logged my EKG’s, and all were normal, “I don’t need this!” Today, there was an irregularity, ‘Possible Atrial Fibrillation’, and THAT made me take notice. Coincidentally, I have a heart doctor appointment tomorrow that I’ve been waiting a month for, and will now find-out what it all means. My Kardia Mobile was worth the expense, I was NOT taking my condition seriously, and now my Kardia Mobile is part of my daily routine and will continue to use it as it has alerted me to a heart-health situation that would have been ignored had I NOT had it. I was foolish!\r\nThanks, Kardia Mobile, I needed that!",

        "comment": "AliveCor is a great tool for my peace of mind.  It's very re-assuring to sit down for 30 seconds after exercise or whenever and take a quick ECG to verify that I'm not in AFib.  It's so pleasing to see normal sinus rhythm.  (Your cardiologist or PCP can show you what to look for in a 2 min lesson, and you can find on-line references to refresh yourself.)  And when I did have what looked like an episode of AFib, I was able to email a PDF of the ECG to my cardiologist so he could see what I was seeing, rather than waiting to go into the office and sit at the machine and probably not have an episode while they were looking at me.  It's a great tool that's helped me stay calm and manage my AFib.",

It’s been EXTREMELY frustrating trying to document my explications of my heart episodes so as to get guidance in solving my ongoing “electrical” problems…until now….I’ve been able to record EKG data and may soon be a candidate for the ablation procedure… we’ll see but at least I finally feel like I’m “fighting” back…,thank you KardiaMobile!",

After being home for two days we hooked up Kardia to her iPhone in 2 minutes we sent the first reading to alivecore and within a few hours had the reply with the ekg letting us know she was back in AFib. We were able to get her back to the hospital and address the issue before the heart was redamaged. As she has no symptoms with AFib we rely on Kardia to monitor her rhythm and prevent heart damage. Note: after the initial reading by alivecore cartioligist, all other readings are immediate and e mailable to your own doctor.  We rely on it, we trust it. \nThe Fullers",

My only complaint with the system is the requirement to log onto the website each time before I can use it.  That becomes tedious after several tries and many failures.  I am 81 years old, and the tiny type on the phone is almost impossible to use without at least one typo when typing the password.  What is the reason for that requirement, if I only want to review it myself, and don't want to have the results reviewed by your team?",

I now have a diagnosis of AFib and have an ablation scheduled soon to fix it. Thanks Kardia. It never happened in the doc office (or the ER!

The ability to assess an ECG at bedside has made a big difference in the number of people I have sent to the ER. The calming ability of showing someone they are not having a heart attack is greatly under reported. I have also helped identify electrolyte imbalances and heart block incidents bcz of its accuracy during events while waiting for equipment and labs. This new generation appears even more user friendly and is a must to update to as I update my phone after 2 1/2 years of use. It was ordered the same day as my preorder for the iPhone 6S and I could not imagine upgrading and not having this ability in hand.",

I can't even say what peace of mind it's been able to give me, relieving the stress of wondering if I was going back into AFIBs (I used to go in and out of AFIB 20-30 times a day).  Now I know that the palpitations I feel are PAC's, it is a great relief.  The only recommendation I would have is that it would be nice if I could trace for longer than 30 seconds, and then stop, capture and record it when I find the 30 seconds I want examined.  I miss many events I could have captured had I been allowed to wait for it.  Instead I have to stop, delete, and then go again.  So that would be helpful.",

A simple on/off switch would have gone a long way. I don't mind the sound when I'm actively capturing a reading, but I'll have to wait 5-10 years before the device stops annoying the hell out of me when I'm not using it.",

I understand this is considered a medical device and its functionality must be verified. However, AliveCore needs to either step up its certification program or give us a warning screen to click through. \r\n\r\nAliveCore, why don't you have an annoying warning come up every time you use this with an unsupported device? \"I understand I am using an unsupported device. I could get misleading results that could be life-threatening\" Something like that. \r\n\r\nGreat device, poor support.",

        "comment": "I purchased my Kardia Mobile just after Christmas after discussing it with my cardiologist. He did not recommend it because the average person would not likely know how to accurately read an EKG. In my case I am married to an RN retired after 40 years. Believe me, if I was left to my knowledge, it would be pretty useless in my hands alone. Medical professionals have years of training in reading EKG and there are a lot of subtleties in an EKG that my wife has a difficult time explaining to me. I'm not a dummy, I was an Architectural Designer for over 38 years. This may not be beneficial to the average lay person. Purchase with caution based on your medical knowledge.",

The strength of my heartbeat varies, so I would like to capture the avg and strongest heartbeat during a recording. I have HCM, so my strong heartbeat does concern me.  I'm not crazy about the results I've gotten when I've sent my ECGs to you to review.  Both times I had unusual events captured, and your online cardiologist service reported normal sinus rhythm.  It would have reassured me if your cardiologist would have said normal sinus rhythm with environmental noise captured, and include a suggestion to put my phone in airplane mode while using Alivecor.",

With AliveCor, I was able to document my episodes and email them to my cardiologist, to qualify for a second ablation in 2015.  This saved so much time, inconvenience, expense, and anxiety.  I also really appreciate having it with me, at home and our travels beyond our state and country, to verify what I feel.  I am amazed at how well it works and how easy it is for me to use when I am not a techno savy person.   Thank you to whomever developed this.",

        "comment": "I always say that the worst thing you can do with an ECG is hold it by the electrodes. That said, if you don't have shaky hands, are looking for gross rhythm issues (AF, runs of VTach) then it's pretty useful, assuming the rhythms are persistent.   I don't trust the filtering for ST segment or QT interval analysis (and anyway you need several leads for that). The signal is just too smooth.  I find it annoying that the device has to be so close to my phone. I like to use it 'off-phone' and the range is very limited.  Being able to move it around the torso would be useful so i could explore several leads sequentially.",

Although this doesn’t provide a comprehensive EKG, but it sure gives any user a basic baseline and if there’s a fluctuation, then it can detect it and be enough of a reason to seek immediate  medical help (i.e., urgent care, emergency department).\n\nEspecially for those without a series 4 Apple Watch (as it features an EKG also), this is a much cost effective alternative. The only downside is having to pay for the premium membership, which is a bit too pricey.",

The app has other ways to help track your help. This can be a life saver. I'm a Retired Paramedic and know how to read the rhythms. You don't need to know how to read them. It is able to pick up on some important rhythms. If you have heart issues, I say this is a great buy.",

Having congenital heart defects has meant that regular monitoring has been a necessary and inconvenient burden for much of my life, but now with AliveCor ECG I have the freedom to go anywhere in the world (or off it!) and at anytime take an ECG should I feel the need. I proved this point recently with a 15 day trekking/climbing expedition in the southern Andes. My team members were impressed with the small size and the ease of operation. The fact I could use it on either my smartphone or tablet was an additional bonus. Thank you for this (potentially) life saving device.",

Easy to use, and I feel confident in it. You have to accept the fact the there will be some funny-looking artifact at the beginning of the tracing, but once it gets going it is a breeze to use.  I've taken it into other doctors' offices to show it off, and nurses in particular love it.",

But the Afib incidents have begun to increase over time and I was beginning to worry about them. My cardiologist suggested Kardia Mobile and it seems to be working very well. I have a new Samsung Galaxy 21+ and it is not yet listed as a compatible device with Kardia Mobile since they have not had time to test it out yet. However the Kardia Mobile device seems work just fine with it after I downloaded the Android app. Kardia Mobile is quick and easy to use and seems accurate. When you are not quite feeling right, it is comforting to find out if you are in Afib or not.",

My episodes are infrequent and can be difficult to identify, since my medications tend to minimize easily felt rapid atrial flutter.The Mobile ECG has been very useful to verify those few occasions when afib \"breakthroughs\" occur. On several occasions where a definitive reading could not be obtained, I've sent the ECG to AliveCor for analysis, and the response was very rapid. My only complaint is that the small unit is somewhat sensitive to signal \"artifacts\", which can result in non- definitive readings.",

I alternated between an Otterbox for phone protection and the AliveCor when I wanted to use the ECG. I got tired of doing that and went to the AliveCor exclusively.

One Kardia ecg graph during an episode was enough to establish a definitive diagnosis of atrial fibrillation!  Cardoguy took one look at the tracing I brought with me and said \"Oh yeah, that's a-fib.\"  I joked with him about my \"toy\", and he said it's not a toy, it may have saved your life of saved you from a bad stroke!

Both devices give me the same nature of results; I can't tell whether the 6L is more accurate or more sensitive, they both seem to detect the same kinds of irrythmias.  The KardiaMobile is easy to use at work, it just takes a few seconds, using two fingers, at your desk.  The KardiaMobile came with a felt carrying case with magnetic closure, included in the box.  At first I didn't quite understand how the KardiaMobile works, it doesn't use bluetooth it uses some sort of high frequency audio to communicate with your cellphone app.  So your cellphone has to be nearby and the microphone can't be hidden from the KardiaMobile, they have to be fairly close to each other and sort of pointing at each other, then they can communicate just fine. I find the real-time results so useful to understand what's going on.  This is so much more valuable than an annual check-up or a one-day Holter Test.",

I wasn't anywhere near any other electronics or transformers.  My next try in the same location worked, but the graft was all over the place.  Tried all the suggestions given by the company online and have yet to get a clean graft.  The quality of the device is good, but you have to pay extra if you want a carrying case.",

The associated Kardia iPhone app records measurement results locally which enables the information to be conveniently presented to your cardiologist or GP during routine visits.  An optional subscription facilitates storing of the EKG measurements in the cloud.  The only criticism, in terms of usage, is that a firm/heavy pressure must be applied and maintained to the electrodes during the 60 second measurement period.  Placing the device on a table or firm surface is mandatory to avoid miss-reads.",

I have a prosthetic aortic valve and I’ve yet to get a good ekg from it since purchase. All I get is that my readings have too much electrical interference no matter where I sit to do\nThis. The idea was to purchase this device and use it to create EKGs and send them to my cardiologist on a weekly basis, but with no readable ekgs that all went out the window. My advice is stay away from this device until they improve the size and stability of the electrode piece of the equipment.",

I had thought I could use Alive Cor to send ECG tracings to my heart doctor for his evaluation,  but instead kept getting dunned to send my ECG Tracings to someone, not my doctor, to be evaluated for a stiff price, not covered by insurance. This product taught me an expensive lesson: Don't let your tech-happy Doctor talk you into something expensive  because HE wants to try it out!",

        "comment": "I purchased the AliveCor app with the electrodes after I had a round of A-Fib.  I am a paramedic and have lots of experience in reading EKGs.  The AliveCor app generally does a pretty good job.  It is obvious that the initial reading has lots of artifact, but there are algorithms that seem to eliminate most, but not nearly all, of that artifact.  Generally, what's left is a fairly decent version of lead 1, but there are still lots of movement anomalies, regardless of how still I am during the reading.  It is more than adequate for finding basic arrythmias, however.   I would purchase it again, but hope that they continue to work on the algorithms.",

The Alivecor plastic case started falling apart a couple of years ago; it's been glued and taped together with electrical tape many times. The unit still works! The Kardia upgrade is not fully compatible; some of the Kardia features do not appear on this older phone, but many do. It records reliably. There are some abberations on some recordings which appear to be frequency interference related, but once you figure out what they are, it is acceptable. I like the unit. A thumbs up (except for the case).",

I worked 40 years as a printer and washed hands many times a day. My fingers are dry and thick, rough skinned. Finally found using a little salty water on my fingers and letting it dry enhanced my conduction on the pads. Tried moisturizers and other lotions but suspect residue actually blocked conduction.I now simply lightly blow on my fingers (like fogging a mirror) and that adds enough moisture to get good reading. The price of the unit is far better than anything else on the market.",

I find it to be a very reassuring resource and like that it saves my ECGs so I can share them with my Cardiologist. The one drawback is that it really cannot get a functional ECG in noisy environments. I cycle along some rather busy roads and occasionally would really like to check for PVCs. Unfortunately road noise prevents me from being able to do so. Beyond quiet interior spaces I find that it can be challenging to get a good ECG. Very happy to have this device, though!",

The problem with the Alive Cor is one has to be still to take the EKG, thus stopping exercise and not getting a reading that reflects the heart working during exercise.  Recently, while using a chest strap on my stationary bike, I caught the very brief racing heartbeat I occasionally feel.  I was cruising along at 120 BPM and suddenly felt my heart racing for a few seconds.  The strap picked up 159 BPM.  I have never been able to capture that with Alive Cor because the racing stops before I can get Alive Cor to read it.",

The Kardia makes me less anxious, as I can be in permanent afib and I want to make sure I am not calling the hospital for nothing. Sometimes the pill in the pocket works and after testing with the Kardia I could let the cardiologist know that my heart had its rhythm back. This week I had to have a cardioversion and using the Kardia for accuracy I can let you know that the values were exactly what the monitor showed!. The battery lasts a long time too. 1 changed recently and I make a lot of EKG’s.",

I had an implanted heart monitor for 13 months and did not feel comfortable keeping it in for another 3 years as recommended after my heart ablation surgery which so far has been successful-I have not had any worrisome episodes for afib and since this loop recorder (Heart Implant) monitor migrated more to my breast area-I did not want to keep it in since I had abnormal mammograms in the past. So far I have been checking my own heart with this less invasive device which is easy to use. I check 2x a day and feel so relieved that I have had no more episodes of afib or other related rhythms.",

It's almost impossible to use it when you feel anxious because you'd just had palpitations or Afib. I would say that 3 out of 10 results taken when I was calm look correct. The rest have results are all over the shop (like, really, impossibly distorted). Even when you catch anything you have absolutely no idea if that was your heart or another problem with the machine.\nNot to mention that you will become obsessed with checking your heart EVEN knowing that the results are unreliable.\nI'm very unhappy about wasting my money for that product.",

        "comment": "When used with emailing the pdf from a patient \"event\" to his Physician or Cardiologist, the App is a superb way of having continuous access to cardiac rhythm events occurring very infrequently. I am asking many of my patients to look at the website, phone application and electrodes embedded in the phone protective case, and it is giving me clinically important information that I was unable to determine previously with 4 weeks of monitoring. Obviously, the events must be long enough for the patient to record, and the patient must be awake and conscious to record them; but in the vast majority of events this is a wonderful addition to heart rhythm management.",

        "comment": "Simple to use and provides an adequate 30 second single lead EKG.\r\nI found at times that I have some trouble getting good contact with the sensors or a good signal to my phone. Repositioning away from the computer desk with a little moisture and pressure helps. I have always managed to get a readable EKG. I purchased this on the advice of a cardiologist to monitor PVCs which I have occasionally. I wish there was an option to capture longer than 30 seconds. You can always run another 30 second strip. So far I have not captured any PVCs. All EKGs I have taken so far interpret as normal which the device does for you itself. I guess I should be thankful for that!",

        "comment": "I bought one of these for a recent trip to Portland where I was at a house with no internet. I chose the Solis Lite because it was cheaper than enrolling in unlimited internet from Verizon and I thought it might come in handy when I travel internationally.\n\nUnfortunately, there are only two plans I could use with this device, a daily plan that is about $5 and an almost $50 monthly plan that limits you to 20 GB at the higher speed until it slows down to 3G during the month. I used up that 20GB in the first few days, and frankly, the \"high speed\" was pretty darn slow, which I thought was weird in a large city that should have plenty of access to high speed sources. There's was no way to purchase faster speed after the 20GB was used, so I ended up having internet that was super slow. Mostly, I had to use my Verizon internet on my iPhone that wasn't part of this WiFi system. Another problem was that the Solis seemed to disconnect a lot. My MacBook was constantly looking for the WiFi, because it the Wi-Fi hotspot was not consistently there.\n\nI still have yet to test it internationally and I'm crossing my fingers that it will work; but if I had my choice again, I would not buy this device.",

        "comment": "I live in the country and thought this would be a worthy replacement for my horribly unreliable satellite internet, but I was wrong. It works ok for working from home and streaming movies (yay!) but because of cell carriers’ “fair use policies,” it’s unable to process large downloads, and I was unable to connect my gaming consoles to the hotspot. This is not mentioned anywhere on Skyroam’s website, and I had to contact customer support three times before I could get an answer about it, and even then their response was “it seems like it won’t work,” which isn’t exactly definitive... Their “solution” was to recommend that I pay for their pay-as-you-go plan, which offers full speed downloads at a rate of $6 per gigabyte. That’s just outrageously unrealistic if I’m downloading large files. I fully understand the limitations at play here, but some more transparency upfront would have been much-appreciated before I spent the money on this device and an extra $99 on the “unlimited” data plan. (Please note that because this device is pre-packaged with a free GB of data, you’ll either have to use the full 1GB or contact customer support to in-bundle it if you want to switch to the unlimited plan).",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I hate this thing so much.\n\nI purchased this for a road trip from Arizona to my home in Alaska in my campervan. I work remotely and needed an internet solution for my time in Canada. I only get 5gb of Data in Canada with my cellular plan and I was looking for a good solution for work.\n\nI purchased this because it offers a North America Data plan and supposedly runs off of all major carrier cell towers, so in theory, if there is cell service on a cellular provider, I should also have internet. I don't and it is garbage.\n\nI can have full bars of LTE on my phone and somehow, my stupid orange puck can't seem to find any internet. Additionally, if there is internet it can say I have full bars on the Solis app but it cuts out severely on every single TEAMS call I have during the day and I constantly get \"reconnecting\" errors. I am sitting in the middle of town when this happens. There is cellular service. \n\nI'm pretty sure Solis gets the worst, lowest level, leftover data blocks from the carriers. At nearly $100 for 50 gigs of internet, it ought to work well. \n\n I hate this stupid thing. It doesn't work. Don't buy it. It is a glorified paperweight.",

The reason I gave it a 5 is because based on the service they gave me I believe they’ll keep improving.\n\nI’ve recently just got back from my two week road trip from FR through Switzerland and IT. The device worked for me for the most part. Stopped working for brief periods in situations like changing borders, changing signals. I’ve also noticed when you plug it in to charge sometimes the signal drops.\n\nI like that it shows on the app whether you’re on a 4G or 3G network. Works perfect for keeping google maps updated through out the long drives and Spotify playing at the same time.\n\nWith that said, could use updates on the firmware for faster load up and Avoid unnecessary signal drops.",

        "comment": "I’m a nomad and have used multiple hot spots. This one is definitely the worst. The app is crap. It rarely loads and once it does, service information won’t change until you force quit and restart it. Which is extremely annoying. The service itself is mediocre at best and too expensive for what they deliver. It gets service maybe a quarter of the time I have service on my phone and calling it high speed is laughable. Even when the app says I have full bars of service, it takes a few minutes to load a webpage and definitely doesn’t work for video calls or mail etching any type of video. I hoped at first it was just based off my first country of use but I’ve found this to be true through multiple countries including the US, Canada, Iceland, England, Scotland, Greece and Italy. Their customer service is pretty quick though, which would be great if it was a fixable problem and not just a crappy product. I would definitely say if you have any actual need for reliable, high speed internet that Solis is not the way to go and is definitely disappointing.",

But as I've stated, it does not seem to hold a charge for more than about 3 hours. That's a major problem and defeats the purpose of buying it.",

For $90 Solis should provide for data. I spent $200 in 4 days because my kids connected their phones and laptops to it also. So I stopped using it after two weeks and I had cable wifi installed.",

You Can't start a day pass without the app on your phone, while on the old device, I could start from the device. Prefer the operation design of the older model.",

I had a little trouble getting started in using it so I messaged them on Favebook messenger and to my surprise, they messaged me back within 15 mins. Within about 10 mins after that I was on my way. It worked great. I have used it in Rome, London, MX, Honduras, Cayman Islands, and Jamaica and all with no problems. When the new version came out, I knew I was going to buy it. I guess when I heard it was new, more portable and a charger, I assumed it would be more compact but it’s not as compact as I hoped for but it worked just as great as before. My son borrowed it to make a large download on his xbox and he had no problems. They make it easy to buy more days and add it to the unit. Now if they could just figure out how to make it useable on a cruise ship, they’d make a fortune and control the market.",

So not the most developed country in the world, and I was in some pretty remote areas where this device couldn't get a signal, so I'm not sure if I would fault the device terribly for that. The locals with cell phones did have a network signal though, so it was odd that people could get a cell phone signal but this little device couldn't. But regardless, when this device did have a signal, it was very dependable and very fast, and I liked having my own, private, secure WiFi to use. Between me and my husband's 2 iPhones, we used about 2 GB of data over the course of 10 days internationally. The battery on the device easily lasted all day long too, and the app makes it very easy to track and see data usage and battery life. I'm sure this hotspot also works like a dream in more developed countries as well.",

On the Solis website they give multiple options for subscriptions and costs including cheaper US only options. All of them were unavailable to me except the most expensive global option. The rest were “grayed out”. When I contacted their services, they took days to respond and didn’t fix the issue. I returned it.",

Not only does it act as a hotspot but can also be used as a power bank. The Solis is easy to set up. There are several options to choose for the amount of gigs you want. It all depends on how you want or need to connect. The best part is the fact that there is no contract.",

Overall, I recommend Skyroam for easy internet access and around there clock support. Thank you!",

The wifi is fast and reliable, and my Solis always starts up in less than 5 minutes. So glad I got one!",

I have used it in many, many countries and the connection has been great in all of them…even the most remote! I’m not sure how it works in US as I don’t use it there.\nIt is easy to use, cost effective and the battery charge lasts all day.  My travel companions (3) can connect and as long as they are close to my Solis they get their WhatsApp and email. I’ve never been so popular!! \nThis is my second (upgraded) hotspot from this company and I have been totally satisfied with both. \nGreat customer service helped me transfer unused daypasses from old model to new without issues.\nIt solved my travel problem and it can solve yours!",

If you sign an auto renew and want to upgrade your plan, you have to cancel (and lose data) in order to be able to upgrade. This can also only be done when you are in range of the unit.  I expect it will be useful when I travel since I don't connect to public wifi. even with the negatives, I would still recommend it as a decent alternative to public wifi or no wifi at all",

You get good service until that limit is hit, then you cannot even stream a Youtube Video.\nI am sure this is done to make you upgrade to a more expensive plan. If I wanted to buy a more expensive plan I would have chosen a 5G plan through my current carrier. The day pass\napproach was exactly what I was looking for until this limit showed up. Don't waste your money on this device if you want to use the day passes.",

Although I have been able to connect and take video call, often the audio cuts in and out and my teammates have trouble hearing me.

Now that everyone is working from home, if I need a little escape or need to go somewhere quiet. I can take it to work from the backyard or a park. It works great! It is light, easy to set up and you can connect many devices. It is affordable as you can get day passes as and when you need them. Looking forward to using it when we go on road trips this summer.",

If I use it I cannot use my Square to accept payments.  The Customer Support from Solis/Skyroam is non-existant!!!  The website doesn't work as it NEVER lets me sign in, even changing my password EVERY TIME I want to log in.  The device works great on our patio, but is not an option for a secure connection when used in conjuction with a Square.  I hope it works when we are camping remotely, but I have yet to try it.  Maybe it would be a good thing if it didn't work.  I am trying to 'turn off' the service until summer, and I cannot even get in touch with the company to do that.  If you buy this and have success with it.  I hope you'll include that in your reviews.  Good Luck!!!",

We had to keep on reconnecting and had to switch our cell data off to avoid being charged when it automatically switched to data after the Solis device dropped the wifi connection. The speed was ok. It took a while to boot up each time turning it on. The size was fine. Not small enough to place in pocket but ok for a bag.

There were few issues but the Skyroam team were there to assist and got me on track right away. You wont regret using this especially if you are the type who travels internationally like JP, Korea, Guam, etc. I have yet to explore the stateside but if their signal could reach internationally what more in the states?!",

The only frustrating thing is that a few times, (when switching carriers I guess), it would drop the connection for a minute. I got cut off in a couple meetings, but it always got me back online quickly. But overall, reliable, convenient, FAR better wifi than I’d get using my phone as a hotspot, and the daypasses are affordable.",

I used mostly for navigation w/ Google Maps, looking up information, checking emails and social media. The unit had plenty of power to last probably 2 days.\n\nThe only trouble I ran into was in Singapore whenever I turned on the unit, it would take 3 to 5 minutes to find a network to connect to.",

A constant supply of WiFi helped us travel around foreign cities without getting lost and allowed us to keep in touch with our relatives at home. Occasionally the Skyroam would take a few minutes to connect to our mobile devices, but it never deterred us from going somewhere. We would simply take the Skyroam with us knowing that our devices would connect automatically in a couple minutes.",

I bought it to use in a major city in Mexico, and I still get only 1 bar of connection, even when I used the feature to connect to a variety of networks. I contacted their support and asked why my cellphone and others around me get full service, but i don't through the Solis. They essentially told me that it's good enough, even though I can't get a stable connection for conference calls.",

I expected the quality to be about cell phone wifi hot spot level, which I hadn't realize was so lousy until I tried to actually stream music through it. The Solis Lite came into my life and legitimately I was blown away by how great it functions. I've had zero connectivity issues in western Massachusetts, USA, and the speed has been greater than I had hoped, and stable. I've recommended this product to a few of my friends who are now probably sick of me raving about it. Thank you, Skyroam, for making such a great little device and providing this service!",

We were able to use it in all the ports on our Panama Canal cruise from Vancouver to Fort Lauderdale. We could even do Facebook updates all the way through the canal. Fantastic! No more looking for free wifi after leaving the ship. When at home or traveling, I take it with me when hiking or even when doing chores around town. Wifi is always with me in my car. I can’t say enough about Customer Service. They are awesome! I’ve demonstrated how easy to use this device is multiple times. I should get a commission! Great Product!",

        "comment": "This is my second Skyroam I have purchased. I was really happy with the new smaller design however the device and service has really let me down.\nI have only used the unit 3 times since I purchased it once in Bucharest once in Warsaw where I simply could not connect to the service. This was poor but I have had trouble connecting other devices in those countries \nBut the biggest failure was in HK where I connected really easy but the Unlimited day Pass was so slow after the first 30 mins it was unusable. I was tempted to purchase unlimited monthly passes but I’m so worried that the service will be so slow it will not be worth it.\n\nMassive disappointment, Can I return It?",

        "comment": "I have been very disappointed with my SkyRoam. I bought it specifically to make WiFi calls and send emails for work while traveling internationally. The service continues to be extremely unreliable despite people around me being able to connect to and use the cellular network for the same activities (and more) than what I am trying to use it for. Support was working for a bit, but now my chat with support refuses to work whenever I don’t have WiFi for calls (even though I have enough WiFi to stream music). I emailed support via the website yesterday to express my frustration problems and have yet to hear from anyone. Please do yourself a favor and look at other products.",

Once it connected it worked fine and did what it is suppose to do. Worked with their customer support on live chat and first he said it wouldnt work in a Verizon area and then few minutes later said it should still connect to any tower. He said he reset something on his end and said to power down and wait. Still didnt help. Tried mutiple times. Dont try their emal. They say they can help then tell you to use live chat after a couple emails. I selected yes for would I recommend but it depends where you live.",

        "comment": "I thinkg Solis Lite wifi service is terrible. \n\nI've been using the service for about six weeks, and have already experienced dozens of dropped connections, which is more dropped connections than I've experience in one year using Solis 1, and more drop connections that I've experience with several other wifi services combined, over the past 13 years. \n\nSometimes I'm fully connected to wifi with 5 bars, but the communication tower isn't responding, so I'm not able to navigate the internet. I have to shut down my PC, shut down the wifi device and reboot. \n\nIf I had not been forced to switch from Solis 1 to solis Lite 5g, I wouldn't be using Solis Lite.\n\nThe service is not stable.",

        "comment": "This is such a great idea and device. It's only at 4G, sadly. However, as always the midwest has issues with towers connections strength being weaker than heck. How it works is it will connect to the strongest provider and you can use their connections. It's either TMobile, AT&T, One Cellular like towers. I bet it is way better overseas like Europe or Asia since networking out there is top notch. Plans are great deal and affordable. I was using unlimited per day pass so it doesn't throttle like the 20G per month.\n\nAnyway until it has 5G+ and towers are update maybe be useful in the USA deadzones. I recommend only if you travel a lot and need to do most the work you could on the go.",

Very dissatisfied. \nHad to purchase a esim as the divorce was not reliable!!! \nSupport told me not to connect too many devices!!! I only had it connected to my phone!! \nThe original one worked so well and was very stable so I don’t know why this new one is not working as well!\nEven when at the Hotel and I’m using it in my phone it heats up terribly!\nI also told people this was an amazing product but I’m not happy with the new one I have! I am only 1 week into my trip snd it really only worked gif the first 3 days!! Then it started heating up and no internet!!!!",

You can buy it up-front in small packages or have it auto-charge. I did both options at different times - did you want to watch a movie on Netflix? My paypal was dinging so much that I didn't even get through a movie without my balance being at $45. I live in SF and my cell service is Verizon. I must've used it twice successfully, and all other times unsuccessfully, and I needed it to do my work! The Solis people were unresponsive to my emails for help or through the app. What a disappointment, and when I needed it to do my work, too.",

I’m on a lot of Teams calls and can go through up to 5GB or more a day, and throttling makes it impossible to connect to meetings. Even the 20GB plan runs out in less than a week.\n\nNot a useful device or solution for my needs, but also did not do a good job of connecting to the best available network even for minimum needs.",

This little thing was exactly what we wanted! It's small and easily fits in my bag that I carry around(and would fit in most purses), the signal was almost always stellar, and the speed was fast enough for all of our needs. It felt like the battery was lasting as long as advertised, and then it charged up fast when it was low. The global day passes worked great for our needs and it saved us some money because we could both connect to it, as compared to us both having to buy individual day passes from our mobile carriers. 15/10 recommend!",

It is easy to set up using the Solis App. I use the pay-per-day option for data so that I am only paying when I need to use it. It saves me money when I travel internationally too. I no longer need to purchase my cell service's international travel plan. The Solis connect up to 10 devices so in addition to my laptop I use it with my phone and then use WiFi calling. It is so light and portable I just stick in my bag or back pocket.",

Used it for the first time in Tokyo everywhere with no problems. Speed was fast and the ability to charge my phone was invaluable. Needed to use Google Map constantly 12-16 hours per day and never lost my Solis wifi connection even in the Tokyo train and subway stations. The battery life was excellent even when I had to charge my phone.\nIf you travel, this is a must have. It's an excellent product.",

In January 2022 I traveled to Barbados and Saint Lucia in the Carribean and this little guy worked exceptionally well.  As soon as I landed I was able to turn it on, connect to the WiFi and effectively have internet to get in touch with my hired shuttle driver and my friends.  The battery lasted pretty much all day and allowed me to get internet on my phone at the beach, in the ungle, wherever I needed it.  In about two weeks I used a little over 1 GB of data, but I had a bunch left from purchasing 20GB during Black Friday :) Very convenient for frequent travelers who don't want to have to worry about purchasing new SIM cards each time they move to a new spot.",

The app is ok, I don't love the interface but it gets the job done. \n\nIt is slow to connect initially as it scans the network which is frustrating as I am mostly using this as a backup for when my primary internet goes out.\n\nThe speed is unreliable, I mostly use it for Zoom meetings and it usually starts fine but within minutes I get messages saying that my internet connection is unstable or slow. \n\nI wish I could also check my data balance and usage on their website as I don't always have my phone handy when I need to use this on my laptop.\n\nIt's great for casual use while traveling to check emails and browse the web but I am not impressed for remote work as I use Zoom a lot.",

Try again later.\"  I know I tried at lease 15 times and always got the same message but no explanation of what was wrong so I assume it was on their end.  I tried their online help and I never could find anything about that error message.  I used the online support and got the message that they were not online.

Every room we have one in is perfectly dry!!! This is a great value not only for money, but for space.",

The area where I&#39;m using it is under the front porch, concrete on all sides, so more damp than a comparable living space of that size, but quite small for a conventional dehumidifier. In a closet or other small living space, the Vanguard would probably be fine. Its quiet, uses little electricity, and accumulates water in the reservoir, so it&#39;s doing its job as advertised.",

When it is time to change the filter.. so that will be interesting to see how easy and how dirty. I will buy one for the bedroom if it is easy to replace filter. it has 2 speeds.. it is quieter on the low speed.",

It was very easy to use and could basically be plugged in right out of the box! It was quiet for the other systems out there. Shipping was fast and the product was better than I expected!

Within two hours of running this little devil my room smells great, and I can take deep easy breaths in with no raspy feeling that dusty and pollen gives me. Being that I have a small canine the room also always has a smell of dog. Right now my room smells like fresh air you get a whiff of on the way to the ocean, before the salt, but in between the city smog and the clean breeze of the coast. Very small and light weight. I think my favorite part is there is no superfluous options, though I&#39;d of enjoyed having a timer to set it so it would turn off after an hour of being out of the house.",

I put a digital thermometer/humidity meter in the car with the dehumidifier running. After a day 2 cups of water were pulled out of the air in the vehicle. I emptied it a few more times with less water each day over a week and now the humidity is down to a level where mold will not grow. It would also be great for a gun safe since it is quite small but does pull a remarkable amount of moisture from the air for it&#39;s size. I&#39;m not sure how well it would work for a whole room since I only used it in a small space but my experience so far has been positive.",

I work grave shifts at my job, and I prefer to have a more natural sounding white noise other than what a smart phone app can provide while I&#39;m sleeping during the day. It actually wasn&#39;t as loud as I was hoping. I ended up switching it out for the one in my daughter&#39;s room, and it seems to work great! It seems to work well in the amount of space, is easy to use, and makes enough noise to be her sound machine without being overwhelming during the night. If you are looking for one that is completely silent, however, this maybe isn&#39;t the one for you.",

If you plan to use it in a room with a draft, or any room bigger than a small bedroom, you will want a bigger /faster drying unit.",

I didn&#39;t want to spend a ton of money or get a large dehumidifier due to limited space and because winter will be here soon so I thought I would give this one a try and would pass it on to my brother for use in his RV if my place was too big for it to handle. I knew it wasn&#39;t really built to handle an entire apartment so I wasn&#39;t expecting it to be perfect but it has made a measurable improvement and is the perfect size for my needs. It&#39;s super quiet and reliably shuts itself off when full which was also important to me. Rather than buying a large unit I would recommend starting with one of these and adding a second one later if one isn&#39;t enough.",

        "comment": "I've been using this air purifier/dehumidifier for a month now. I would say that it's been working very well so far. This summer has been rainy so it can get mildly hot and humid in my apartment. I was using those moisture absorbers (with the white beads) from the dollar store for a while, but I felt like it wasn't sufficient in really sucking the moisture out of the air.   I use the JS Vanguard in my living/dining room (approx 240 sqft area) or my washroom which can get quite damp (no windows). I typically leave it running while I'm at work and it accumulates about 1/4 of the small tank of water. I've also left it running over the weekend if I'm going away, and it accumulates over 1/2 a tank of water. I've yet to let it fill all the way.   In terms of air purification, I don't have any pets and there aren't any particularly terrible odours in my apartment, but I've noticed there is a lot less dust gathering on the floor of my unit, so I am very happy about that. Before using this device, I'd have a lot of dust gathering each week.  All in all, I'd say it was well worth the money. It's a beautifully designed appliance that functions very well.",

You can also download the BR-Receipts program, this makes the scanner even more useful. As you can scan to a data base and sort your receipts by date and vendor name. I have tried both ways of scanning my receipts and I prefer the BR-Receipts app.",

You can’t edit an image while you are scanning it so you have to have a different program just to crop the picture. Also if you are scanning a 4x6 you will have a massive white border. Basically it scans an 8x11 so anything smaller will have white all around it but hey you can’t edit it to crop it when you scan it in you have to save it then open up in another program to edit not worth it",

I love how this product can easily adjust to the document size whether it`s a card or a full sheet of paper and it aligns perfect so no need to rescan!

I tried unplugging it for a while, opening the scanner to remove anything that was stuck and to clean it, re-installing the drivers, re-loading the scanner settings in the software, etc... the image would be 100% black on every scan thereafter.\n\nThen I put it in a pocket in my backpack which houses many other electronics and cords for those electronics. The cord to this scanner is very cheaply made and melted all over the place. I had to wipe the gunk off of all the other things in that pocket. Luckily it was only stuff I could clean in there, but it did ruin a large pocket in my backpack, and now I need to buy a new scanner and a new backpack...",

Although it never asked for a serial number, twice it told me my product had either already been installed, or didn't exist. I didn;t give up and found the software, installed it, and clicked \"scan\". HOLY COW, this thing is awesome! So glad I didn't give up, I've only used it for a full page scan, but see that it scans receipts and other items. I have seen similar scanners at the Dr office and maybe this is what they used. Super compact, easily stored near your computer or laptop. I plan to use with a laptop so I don't have to go to my desktop printer/scanner. Quality looks great and is super fast.\r\nOnce again, if you get one, don't give up, The overall result is worth it!!",

I've purchased two of these scanners (returned the first due to the same issues) in hopes of having luck and to no avail. The scanner drivers and software install with no problems, and it will remain online until I scan a single page. The machine disconnects from my computer after ever page it scans. First one did as well. I have to leave the device unplugged for about an hour, plug it back in, then reinstall the machine to my laptop in order to scan another single piece of paper. It doesn't make scanning calculus homework (the primary reason for purchase) a fun time. I have never had such a fiasco with a simple piece of machinery, and I intend on returning this yet again and getting a different brand of scanner. I'm happy for all the ones that work for people, but I am incredibly dissatisfied with this product.",

I have limited space, so having a bulky scanner was just not an option for me. The size is quite easy to store in small places. The hardware was fairly easy to access online and set up. I have uploaded several family photos and will eventually upload to the cloud so my whole family can share all our old family photos. If your into ancestry, this will be a useful tool as well to upload those documents and old photos to your accounts to share your historical documents with relations from around the world. I have lots of plans for this great scanner. Archiving my artwork, scanning family cookbook recipes....the ideas and projects are endless. I can't wait! I still have to learn to tweak a few things to my liking and wish that after I scanned photos they would display the icon of the image itself so I can more easily separate the documents, but it may be something I can figure out how to remedy with a little research online. Overall, great product!",

I tested the scanner using a desktop by plugging in the USB 3.0 cable into my computer. The box includes a, \": Quick Setup Guide\", USB 3.0 (Micro USB Cable), Calibration Sheet, and Warranty Card. You are able to view a detailed instruction guide on support.brother.com/manuals. I used internet explorer to view the manual, as Chrome for some reason didn't work for me. \r\n\r\nThis particular scanner scans one-page documents at a time. Images were clear and readable that were scanned. Scanned receipts, bills, pictures, and personal information. I included a scanned image of the registry for you to see. Be sure to line the page up properly for an even scan. I scanned in a recent memorial program for a loved it and the pictures showed up clearly. \r\n\r\nPlease note that it is recommended to use a calibration sheet to scan certain documents which may include and are not limited to (items that are written in pencil, photographs, damaged documents, etc). The calibration sheet must be purchased separately. \r\n\r\nPros:\r\nPortable\r\nCan scan documents, images, and cards\r\n\r\nCons:\r\nWould like it a cellphone option (but know there is an upgraded version of this one)\r\nSD Card Slot",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] We already have a flatbed scanner, “have owned many over the years” but have never had a portable one. I happen to see Brother had some new models come out so decided to give this a try as it would be nice to be able to have the scanner on the desk with the computer/laptop instead of going into another room to scan documents, and one to take with us on business trips.\r\n\r\nUnboxing:\r\nThe scanner itself is considerably smaller than the box it came in. At first when I saw the box I was wondering just how large this “portable scanner” would be. To our relief it didn’t take up much room at all in the display box. Inside the scanner was well cradled in a cardboard frame and included a USB cable, guides and that’s it.\r\n\r\nSetting up:\r\nSetting up the device was pretty simple, just plug the USB cable into the right side of the unit and plug the other end of the cable into an open USB 3 port. The cable isn’t that long and do wish it was longer, another foot or two would have made it easier to move around the desk. With the USB port being on the right side you have to figure out placement so either a longer cable or putting the port on the back may have been better “nothing major to complain about though”.\r\n\r\nThe software install was pretty straight forward, just go to the Brother website and download the installation package. You will have to register your device and use the included code on the bottom of the unit to register a couple of them though.\r\n\r\nUsing:\r\nThis compact scanner came with plenty of applications to get your scanning jobs done. You have software that you can scan and store your receipts “Br Receipts”, business card software “Presto BizCard” , regular scanning software “Brother I Print and Scan” and a nice PDF editor “Kofax Power PDF”. Using the Power PDF software was really straight forward and is really fully featured. If you do a lot of PDF work you will really appreciate it.\r\n\r\nI also have been using the Presto BizCard software and we really like it. It scans a business card in just about 2 seconds and so far has read all the information on the cards correctly. It organized all of them in an electronic rolodex and makes looking up information a snap.\r\n\r\nI’ve also tried scanning some photos, “our other scanners did that pretty good, most not that great” but I was floored just how good this one scanned some color photos. The colors on screen really matched up well with the scanned photos and when printing them out they came out very close to the original. We’ll be using this little scanner to go through all our old photos and get them scanned in. The big plus is it’s faster and more convenient to use for that as all you have to do is feed them into the slot. No messing around with covers and making sure the photos are centered or squared on the flatbed scanner.\r\n\r\nIf you are looking for a compact / portable scanner I’d take a serious look at this new little Brother DS-640. It’s not very expensive and its performance is better than our other flatbed scanners, plus it’s more convenient. This one is a very basic portable scanner; it doesn’t come with all the bells and whistles. But if you need a scanner that’s more portable, has external storage or wireless connection abilities then you may want to get of the more advanced “and higher priced” models offered by Brother.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Brother's DS-640 is a mobile scanner because it is compact - about the size of a rectangular-ized paper towel roll. It feels solid and well-built - not at all fragile.\r\n\r\nThe scanner recognizes documents as soon as they are inserted and processes them almost without flaw - uncharacteristically well for something other than a flatbed scanner (or the equivalent in a home office printer). It made no mistakes deciding how to process everything I fed into it (color, black-and-white, gray scale).\r\n\r\nFor a scanner this size, it gets five stars without even so much as a moment of hesitation. And, technically, this review is designed to address the hardware.\r\n\r\nBut all hardware requires drivers and software to be useful. And I had a little bit of trouble getting the driver to recognize the hardware - how is that even possible in 2020? And though packaged pdf software is fairly nice, it's only a 15 day trial. And I don't appreciate it when packaged software for basic functionality requires an up-charge. \r\n\r\nI included copies of my first test scan - Brother's Limited Warranty for this product - and the first page of the corresponding OCR (not bad).\r\n\r\nFor a scanning device that looks more like a wand than a legitimate scanner, this is a very impressive piece of hardware. Surely Brother will have a better driver in time - and you should probably plan to pair this device with your own software.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] There is one thing you're going to notice about this scanner, it is very small and extremely light. This scanner is well made, it is white with black accent and it looks very nice. On the upper right corner has the start/stop button and a power indicator light. It is very simple to use, just plug it to any laptop running Windows or Mac OS, get the drivers and you're good to go. One thing I did have to do was to download the actual drivers, plugging it in and did not do the job right out the box and this was on Windows 10. In the driver installation package you get the brothers iPrint software which is easy to use. The quality of the scanned images were excellent even in color. \r\n\r\nThe scanner has a small leveler which you use to adjust the paper size up to 4A (11.5), and it also scans IDs, credit cards and business cards. You can only feed one paper at a time but it is pretty cool how the device locks the paper in place once it detects it on the feeder and it scans pretty fast. This is designed for the traveler and people who work on the go, again this device is very light, compact and simple to use. However, there are some downsides, one of them being that it needs to be plugged into a laptop for it to work. Also this scanner does not have a built in battery, WiFi or Bluetooth connectivity.\r\n\r\nOverall if you don't mind having to plug this to a laptop and scan one page at a time this will definitely get the job done and is very portable. This scanner will work with Windows, Mac and even Linux. I tried it with Chrome OS but it didn't work. In the box it comes with the scanner USB3 cable and manuals. \r\n\r\nPros:\r\nLight weight \r\nPortability \r\nSimplicity \r\nScanned Images\r\nDesign and Built quality\r\n\r\nCons: \r\nMust be plugging to Laptop \r\nNo WiFi\r\nNo Bluetooth\r\nNo built in battery\r\nOne Page scanning",

Good scanner- it scans pretty fast and both, in color and black/white. Its compact and lightweight and since its USB Powered, it doesn`t require wall outlets, which helped make my workplace tidier and clutter free. I`ve scanned receipts, business cards, identification cards, invoices, photographs, and more in the last few weeks and they`ve all come out great. Also the multi page scanning is fairly easy and the Brightness and Contrast can be adjusted to optimize the scans. So far, product has served its purpose very well and I am very satisfied with the scanner.",

For a portable scanner, it gets the job done. I scanned a bunch of things with this scanner. It has a little slot that moves to help guide the thing that you are scanning. It works great on papers or pictures that are thicker than usual. I tried to scan receipts and it had a hard time cause the receipts are very thin. One thing it does well is auto crop the thing you scanned. Overall it`s pretty good, super easy to set up took me like 10 mins. If you`re on the go or space is limited this thing is looking to get.",

I bought this mostly for pictures, but is has scanned documents, racing bibs and pictures with excellent color reproduction.\n\nI did install the software that was recommended, but technically I could have used the built in one for My MacBook Pro, but I’m glad I used the other one. It makes it easy to add additional pages to the same document. Overall, I would totally buy this again. It can’t do two sides at the same time, but that is not a big deal considering pictures were the primary reason. I wanted this scanner.",

I used this scanner to digitize my family's photo albums so that we had a digital archive that can be accessed anywhere. The quality is high enough that if I wanted to reprint any of these photos, there would not be a significant loss of quality. And the file sizes are not storage limit destroyers for wherever you choose to store the digital files. \n\nOnce you get into a flow, the scanning process goes relatively quickly. The scanner does jam frequently but because of the size, all you have to do is pop it open and try again. If you don't rush it, it won't jam.",

I use this scanner for receipts - they feed through easily and quickly, and set at the default 300 dpi the scans are quick and the images are sharp. This scanner is not wireless so it has to be connected to a laptop or desktop PC to work. The scanner is compact and lightweight so you could pack it in a bag with a laptop for on-the-go scanning, but the Brother wireless scanner for about $60 more might be a better choice if you need one for use on-the-road.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Brother DS-640 Compact Mobile Document Scanner \r\nBrother’s printer and scanner products never disappoint me. They seem to outlast my other equipment and work reliably. And, so again, I’m enjoying a portable scanner that was up and running only minutes after plugging it in and installing some software. No excuses, no problems. \r\n\r\nSETUP/INSTALL: Download the software. There are a couple of choices, and either works fine. There was a firmware update available, and that took moments to install, too. Plug in the printer and open the APP. You can select your Resolution (up to 600 x 600), File Type, color or B&W, size, and destination. Under advanced settings you can change brightness and contrast. Scanning is initiated from the App. Place the to-be-printed photo, paper, sketch into the front slot of the scanner, and initiate scanning from the APP. There is no auto-document feeder. While the scan is accomplished the image pops up in the App on your screen. \r\n\r\nPERFORMANCE: The scans are colorful, detailed and fast. Your selection of file type will determine what you will use to edit or enhance your scans (I use either Photo or Photoshop Elements --- NOT included). It’s all very straight forward. It’s hard to find fault with the scanner at all. It just works. \r\n\r\nI will remind other buyers that you should be sure you want a manual scanner. Brother has an autofeed version. It also has scanners that work with mobile devices. This model is intended to plug into the USB port of your laptop/desktop. I scan old photos and my grandkids artwork. I don’t care about auto-feed. My only “wish for” is that a nice carry case be included in the box. These wonderfully portable devices are not so portable if there is no protective carry case/shell/bag. \r\n\r\nBut, I still like it a lot. It's easy to recommend Brother’s DS-640 scanner.",

And fast!! There is a small lever which you adjust to the size of the item being scanned; this keeps the item going straight through\r\n\r\nThe software makes scanning a breeze. Simple place your item, face up, in the scanner and press scan. After you scan a page, it allows you to 'add' other scanned pages to the same document. You have a choice of save formats, including jpeg, pdf, txt and rtf. You can save to PC or to the cloud.\r\n\r\nI am going to enjoy using this at conferences!!",

It`s about the size of a compact umbrella so it could fit in a tote bag. Mobile- You can travel with it in a tote or laptop bag. Only a usb cord is needed. Weighs a pound or two.Quality- The images uploaded were good quality/resolution.Operation- Very simple to use. Didn`t require much directions.Durability- It is sturdy and solid. I would take alot of force to break it.Cons:Connectivity- There was no wifi or bluetooth connection. It would be great to have this option and make the scanning completely mobile. I would love to scan and upload wireless as an option.Installation- I had some difficulty with installing the software initially. I believe the software needed to simplified to only one step. A simple install once screen. The application prompted to install other programs once I got to the home screen of the brother application. The space it took up on computer was a bit much. I would deter people from installing it on multiple devices which defeats the purpose of being mobile.Memory- It lacked a slot for a micro sd card or any memory to be stored.Operation- It didn`t have a pop out tab to guide papers through.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Opening the box, it contained the mobile scanner, MicroUSB 3.0 cable and a quick start guide. The guide instructed me to go to the Brother software support download page and download the full install pack for the scanner. I had to do a search for the model number and then it was a quick download. \r\n\r\nI started the software and on step 3 or 4 it couldn't find the unit. I tried a few times, turning the unit off/on or checking the cable. Nothing worked. I was using a front panel USB port and I don't have any available in the rear, so I figured try one of the two on my Seagate external drive. Tada, the software skipped searching for the scanner and immediately saw it. That was the only hiccup I ran into. It breezed through the rest of the install and it was time to test it out. I ran a page of my bank statement through the scanner and the scan quality was very good. I like the software and the small pop up it generated. All it took was to insert the statement and hit the start/stop button easily found on the top of the unit. It took a number of seconds and then it did a fast scan. The pop up stated it was done and had a button to click if I wanted to open the file that it was saved in. Nice feature as some users get lost and don't know where they saved the file.\r\n\r\nThere are codes for Nuance Power PDF (Windows and OsX) on the bottom of the scanner.You can download the software on the same page as the full install. It installs very quickly and easily.\r\n\r\nOh, you can scan a number of sizes up to an A4. There's a movable guide on the feed with markings for A4, B5, A5, A6, and a symbol that looks like envelope (I'll have to check it out in the manual). The unit is very portable, 11.5 inches wide by 1 inch tall and 2 inches deep. It weighs under 1.5 lbs according to the box. I don't think it's that much, but it is hefty enough that it doesn't feel like it's not going to stay put. Overall a great portable scanning unit.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Brother - DS-640 Compact Mobile Scanner - White\r\n\r\nThe Brother scanner DS-640 is a mobile, stand alone scanner. It is powered by the USB-3 cable and requires no additional power. The software installation is all done online, so you will have to have an internet connection to get the scanner software. Additional software is also included but that also requires internet access and there are a few hoops to just through to get the additional software installed and working. It is my honest opinion that the brother software works the best and is easiest to use. I found the PDF and Organizing software to be overkill for a portable scanner that does a good job but will not replace your full size scanner. I scanned black and while pages as well as photographs. It seems the scanner is scanning everything as a .jpg and then the software converts it to what ever you decide. There is a Start button on the scanner and for documents you can just use that. When scanning photos, you’ll want to use the brother iPrint&Scan software that gets installed. There are setting for just about everything you would want to do. All scans were legible and in focus. The documents show jpg artifacts in the background unless you use the software do a background removal on them. The document is then cleaner, but some fine edges are missing. The additional PDF software is just a replacement for Adobe Acrobat. Since it’s included and is a full suite, with edit capabilities, it makes sense to use it if you don’t have a full version of Acrobat.\r\n\r\nI like the size and the fact that because it’s powered by USB it can be ready when you need it, no waiting for a battery to charge. All in all, it is a good portable scanner with descent software included (even if you have to do a little hoop jumping to get it installed). At no point did the instructions fail to make sense. The instructions are few, but the software allows you to follow along and get everything set up.\r\n\r\nWhen first used I did not get acceptable scans. It comes with a calibration sheet, so I followed the instructions and used it. That cleared up the image issues. From that point on it worked fine.\r\n\r\nIt will be placed in my laptop bag so I can scan things while on the road.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This might be one of the best tech products that I will get this year. Not only is it a quality scanner that scans in both color and black/white, its light, portable and comes with very functional software to make it even more of a necessity for the laptop bag. Weighing in at 1.029 lbs., it is only 1.99\" x 11.85\" x 1.45\" in size which makes it a perfect mobile scanner. It is powered by a laptop (or desktop) computer using the micro USB 3.0 cable that comes in the box. \r\n\r\nThe DS-640 can scan many types of documents from plain paper, photos, receipts, business cards and even plastic/laminated cards, and that also includes embossed laminated cards. It can scan at a speed up to 16 ppm and is capable of scanning documents as single pages or multi-pages and provides the option of either saving the scanned document in a Secure PDF, Searchable PDF, or PDF/A format. The scanner is designed to work with the operating systems of Windows, Mac OS and Linux.\r\n\r\nBeing compact and light certainly makes the DS-640 mobile. But Brother must realize that mobile isn’t all there is to making a product be useful, necessary and integral to a person’s lifestyle. The software that is included with the DS-640 is the other part of this procurement that makes it all so important for me. The software allows for scanning to various destinations including File, Image, OCR, Email and various cloud services. I can also just scan it to my laptop’s hard drive or external drive. No longer do I have to schedule a part of my week just to input scanned receipts, I can now scan them easily on the go. Other great features of the included document management and OCR software is that this software allows me to turn any of my hard copy documents into editable Microsoft Word files. The scanner will accommodate 72” long documents that are up to 72 lbs. in bond weight. The document and OCR software and the ability to scan so many types of media make this very useful for me in my daily work of making flyer’s and posting sales ads. It is a real time saver. The Brother Receipt Software that works great with this product is also a great time saver as I am sure I will appreciate it even more come tax time when it is all compiled for me and in Quicken which I purchased separately.\r\n\r\nIf you are looking for a very nice mobile scanner, or even if you are just tired of keeping up with receipts for your business or work, you owe it to yourself to check out the DS mobile scanners by Brother. This is their compact mobile scanner, but there are a couple of other models that you might want to compare with this one before purchasing. I love my little scanner. The compact size and light weight are awesome! It is just a great and welcomed tech accessory to have.",

        "comment": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I tend to prefer Brother over most other brands because the products are generally of higher quality but not higher price. I also like the software that accompanies Brother products because it is easy to use. This scanner meets all of these expectations, but lacks in one area in the ease-of-use.\r\n\r\nThis is not a \"bells and whistles\" scanner. It allows you to scan one page at a time (no feeder), and it must be connected via USB to your device. The software makes it relatively easy to scan a multi-page document by adding additional pages to the job until you are ready to save it, but each page must be loaded and the button pressed. Depending on your usage needs, this may not be a big issue.\r\n\r\nBrother is assuming a certain amount of familiarity with setting up a device like this one, as there is a brief set-up document included in the box, but that's it. There is no software CD, so everything must be downloaded from their website. This is normal today, but if you are not familiar with Brother's website, it may take you a few minutes to find exactly what software you need.\r\n\r\nOnce installed, the software is SUPER easy to use. So is the scanner once you figure it out. It took me a few minutes to figure out that the paper sensor is on the left side of the scanner, and the fact that if you get it just right (it's a little finicky), it will \"grab\" the page just enough to load it. Hit the button and it quickly scans the page. It is quick for a scanner of this size, so very happy there.\r\n\r\nThe quality is great. Text is clear and readable. The colors, at least in default settings, are not perfectly accurate, but for documents, this shouldn't be much of an issue in most cases. This is NOT a photo scanner, but I scanned a couple of properly-exposed photos, and they looked good. Not great, but certainly shareable. They were a little over-exposed in the scan, but I probably could have tweaked the settings a few times to improve the exposure and color.\r\n\r\nThe issue I had with this scanner was obtaining the software BR-Receipts, which is offered in a separate flyer inside the box. The website refused to recognize the Serial # of my product, and I had to go through a lot of back-and-forth to try to obtain the download.\r\n\r\nThe BR-Receipts software is very similar to other programs I have used. It allows you to create a folder structure to organize your receipts, and it does its best to read data directly from the receipts. Unfortunately, I had to give the program a lot of assistance in detecting where the key data was located (store name, date, amount, sales tax). For each receipt, you have the opportunity to verify (and correct if necessary) the data from the receipt. I am guessing that after scanning a few receipts from the same retailer, it would eventually figure out the receipt layout, but for the first couple I tried, I had to help it almost every time. There is also a field for \"Comments\". This is VERY useful to enter specifics about the purchase, as the software includes a search feature that worked very well. This is especially useful if you scan receipts for key purchases (electronics, appliances, etc) that you may need to recover the receipt at a later date, maybe for warranty purposes. You can also run reports based on the data from the receipts, and export it to several file types, including PDF, CSV, QIF for Quicken, and QuickBooks (including IIF). \r\n\r\nOverall, BR-Receipts is great addition to this scanner, but at least initially, it is not a very quick process, so be prepared if you have piles and piles of receipts. Also be prepared to figure the software out on your own, as I could not find any kind of tutorial. Again, Brother software tends to be easier than most, but the help is limited.\r\n\r\nAs for the scanner, if you have small scan jobs, or are in need or a portable scanner to take with you, this is a great option, as it's affordable and easy to use. Recommended!",

There is available software for business cards and receipts as well as the standard scanning software. I was particularly impressed with the business card scanning. I slid the spacer to the position for business card scanning, ran the software and it put the card information into a business card database. Impressive. I scanned some documents as well and was very impressed by how fast this thing is. The scans are bright, crisp and true to color.\r\n\r\nThe device itself is small enough to fit into my backpack. I actually prefer that it plugs into my laptop via USB rather than connecting via Bluetooth. That way I don’t have to remember to charge it up before using it. It’s just always ready. \r\n\r\nThis is a great scanner for road warriors. The receipt scanner is a must if you need to keep track of your expenses.

I ran a page of my bank statement through the scanner and the scan quality was very good. I like the software and the small pop up it generated. All it took was to insert the statement and hit the start/stop button easily found on the top of the unit. It took a number of seconds and then it did a fast scan. The pop up stated it was done and had a button to click if I wanted to open the file that it was saved in. Allows setup of multiple workflows for one-click scanning in a variety of formats - text, pdf, jpeg, etc.\r\n\r\nThere's a movable guide on the feed with markings for A4, B5, A5, A6, and a symbol that looks like envelope (I'll have to check it out in the manual). The unit is very portable, 11.5 inches wide by 1 inch tall and 2 inches deep. It weighs under 1.5 lbs according to the box.\r\n\r\nI would definitely recommend this product to anyone.",

        "comment": "So far so good! My boyfriend and I are both smokers. We try and stay in our room with it to avoid the smell throughout the rest of the house. This obviously makes our room smell. I&#39;ve had this going for about 18 hours straight and in that time I&#39;ve noticed the smell decrease a little bit, but the actual smoke disappears within minutes. I keep it on my nightstand next to my side of the bed. My mother, who is asthmatic came over and usually she can&#39;t come into my room because of the smoke. She complemented this air purifier and said it&#39;s a lot easier for her to breath in there.   I did not expect the smell itself to go away completely, I just wanted a reduction in smoke and it&#39;s working great! I plan to change my filter more often than it says it&#39;s needed. It&#39;s a little bit bigger than I expected (it takes up about 1/3 of my nightstand) but in my opinion as long as it works I&#39;m good! I plan on buying on to put it diagonally on the other side of the room because my room is larger than the space that is recommended in the information book. It came with very easy directions and is very easy to put the filter in and gives instructions on how the buttons work. Yes it comes with a filter as well.",

        "comment": "I suffer terribly from seasonal allergies. Spring/ Summer is not a welcome season for me unless I drug up every day with pills and nose sprays. I wanted to find a better way, so I bought one of these units. Then I bought another, then another and then another. I keep one in my bedroom, and it&#39;s a miracle (praise the lord) I can sleep all night without any breathing problems waking me up all night. I keep one in my home office, and no longer go though a box of Cleanex every week. Then there&#39;s the one in the living room and one in the kitchen. As long as I stay in the house I&#39;m a free man (hallaluha). It&#39;s not a perfect solution, but it&#39;s a whole lot better than my previous existence. One of the four air filter starting making a little noise the other day (did I mention they are very quiet, and will actually lull you to sleep with their soft whisper), I emailed the company with my complaint and with no hassle at all they are sending me a new unit. These things are fairly small and stylish and if I start to have an allergy attack when I am doing chores around the house I can always retreat to the safety of my home office for some relief. These things are great and I plan to buy another one for my grandson to help him with some respiratory problems he is having.",

        "comment": "This seems to be working. It is very loud, like a medium sized fan when it is turned to 2 or 3. I was happy to see I can turn off all the operating lights so the room is dark with out those mother ship lights gleaming in the corner of the room.   It will dry out your space, so be aware of that if you wake up with a dry nasal passage. For me, this is a good thing. Since moving to this house, I&#39;ve had non stop allergies that turn into low grade sickness and nonstop runny nose with a cough. I can tell it&#39;s because of the air quality and mold. My allergies get kicked up when it snows and rains from mold and little critters making their way inside the walls and sometimes in the house for my 2 giant cats to play with. Also, there is a fog of exhaust from all of the house&#39;s heating systems that I can smell in my hair when coming in from walking my dog in the morning.   I keep the house very minimalist and clean, but there is only so much you can do with a bi-level (meaning half is in the ground as a semi-basement with the heating equipment inside the house). I would wake up in so much pain from pressure and blocked sinuses and sneezing. My dog and cats even had problems. They all snored and one kitty would get a weepy eye when allergens were high. We are a fairly &quot;Green Family&quot;, meaning we eat whole, organic, non-processed foods and we don&#39;t use any pesticides around the house or &quot;bad&quot; chemicals to clean. Vinegar and natural soap kill as many molds and bacteria as chlorine, FYI, without doing a number on your thyroid.",

It worked great to get the dusty smell out, and my throat is clear now instead of me having to cough up flem for hours every morning, so I appreciate this very much, and very affordable.The night light is adjustable, and turns on and off, and is a nice soft green light, donât have a photo yet, but I am very happy with it, light, small, and easy to move, and QUIET! most importantly of all, practically silent, a small soft soothing white noise only on 2nd and 3rd setting",

Amazing value for your money with all the features that come with the JS FLO, including the App that allows you to set any an operating schedule however you want. It is so versatile. And performance wise, I'm extremely satisfied. I placed the unit in different rooms to do some before and after results, and the difference is noticeable within 15-20 minutes. This is some of the best money I have spent in a long time. I will be using this unit mostly in my bedroom where 2 cats like to sleep! The noise is barely noticeable which is definitely one of the best features. \n\nOverall, this air purifier works wonders considering its compact size, has great features  and is worth every penny. I am a very happy customer",

I put it in a bedroom with area of about 180-200 sq ft, and the air has become noticeably fresher and cleaner soon after I started the purifier. It is quiet enough that you can sleep with it when it runs at low speed; at maximum speed it makes some noise from the fan, but you can&#39;t hear the motor. Overall, a great device, we are very pleased with it. In fact, so pleased, that we intend to buy another one and put it in another bedroom!",

The LED lights are green, although I am not so sensitive to light or turbine sound during sleep I am able to keep it turned on all night. You can set it on for 2, 4 or 8 hours and at 3 speed options which is great, if you want to reduce the noise. It's better than a fan!",

Iâve never been so glad to be wrong. Iâve used the purifier every night & have not had 1 allergy day. This is a huge deal because I usually had 1 every week that was so severe I would be drugged up on benedryl & still sneezing my head off. This purifier gave me my allergy free life back... thus far; hoping it last through next pollen season!",

        "comment": "This thing works great for small spaces. We smoke and have 2 dogs and a ferret,so things can get funky pretty quick. I've been using this for months and I think I have a good idea what it can and can't do- what it can do is obliterate smoke,dust and general funkiness for a small or medium room and it can do it relatively quietly and relatively cheaply. The filters last a decent amount of time,over 6 months each depending on how often it's on and on what setting,and are pretty affordable- and it doesn't keep either of us up at night. What it can't do is handle a whole house or whole floor,provide any real air flow,or cool a room. Overall I'm very pleased and would recommend it to any indoor smokers or pet owners.",

Problem is, the laundry room is connected to the kitchen and who wants to EVER smell litter box odor in their kitchen?? Problem solved! And as an added bonus, the kitchen itself even seems fresher. Kudos to this little machine for working even harder then we asked it to! Super easy to set up, very quiet, long cord, looks nice and above all else-- IT WORKS!  Will be buying another for our bathroom soon!",

It's been two months now, and things are going very well. He has minimal allergy issues, but cats aren't his only allergy.

We had been having problems in that room with litter box odors and that gross feeling of inhaling the dust from the litter and read that an air purifier might help with those problems. After just a day, the JS FLO air purifier has made a huge difference! It actually smells fresh in our office again and we don&#39;t feel the need to constantly have our windows open.  One thing to note: the device is a bit bigger than I was expecting. It is about as big around as a desktop PC tower, but isn&#39;t as long. This wasn&#39;t a huge deal for us because we were just planning on putting it in the corner anyway.   All in all, we&#39;re very happy with it!",

We don&#39;t care if people smoke, we would just rather not have it in our home. We have tried plug-ins, wax warmers which would help some, but it was still very noticeable at times. We love our apartment and didn&#39;t want to move, so we decided from the reviews to try th JS FLO Purifier. What a blessing? We plugged it in and put it in what we thought was the problem area and from day one we have been smoke-smell free. We keep it on fan speed 2 and if we smell a hint of smoke we crank it up to 3 and the air is cleared up almost instantly. It is quiet, the perfect size and affordable. So glad we made the purchase!",

I&#39;m impressed by this unit and it&#39;s perfect for my studio apartment.   Please note-- I didn&#39;t realize that air purifiers (at least ones that really work!) do dry out the air. It&#39;s inevitable. I&#39;ll likely buy a small humidifier to try to counteract that, but in the meantime the subtle cat odors are gone and I recommend this item to anyone.",

So I thought I would try an air purifier.  I loved the look of this product so i bought one.  It took a few hours (high ceilings) but it did clear out the smoke. Because of its size, I move it from room to room with me throughout my day. I am looking forward to seeing how it helps with my allergies in the coming months but I have high hopes.",

Granted my wife and I do not have the biggest bedroom this little air purifier works so well we both sleep better and breath better. the first 3 nights with this thing were great and they only get better. The little green light is pretty cool.  Level 1 - Very quiet does a good job Level 2 - Normal noise level for one of these Level 3 - You can definitely hear this thing going. (Probably couldn&#39;t sleep with it on 3 unless you like a noticeable white noise)",

I will note that I have only had it for about 2 weeks, but do notice differences after plugging in for a few hours.",

You can set it on for 2, 4 or 8 hours and at 3 speed options which is great, if you want to reduce the noise. It's better than a fan!",

        "comment": "The2018 fires in BC really affected the air quality in my home. (Fortunately, that was all I had to deal with from the fires!) I was having trouble breathing, even inside, so I bought two of these air filters to clear up the air. They work like a dream (granted, I&#39;ve only had them for about a month at the time). I could tell immediately the air quality was better. I stopped waking up with a sore throat and didn&#39;t feel as sick -- no more headaches and slight nausea.  The air filters are pretty quiet. After the initial medium blast setting, I put them on low. I run them continuously and I&#39;ve stopped hearing the noise -- not that there is much to hear to begin with, particularly on the lowest setting.  My only &quot;complaint&quot; is the air filter also seems to suck a lot of the moisture out of the air. My nose has been dry since I started using the air filters. So maybe now I need a humidifier.... Ah well....",

        "comment": "I bought this because the quality of the air in the house is bad. Reading the reviews and purchasing this was the best thing for my problem. Small, elegant and mostly very efficient! The air is clean. No pet dander, hair, dust and much more were captured in my first filter. Grqb this for a basic room and the filter will cost you $10 a month and totaly worth it",

        "comment": "Good product, seems to do the job. There is one major con though. This unit does not seem to move enough air. The CFM (that&#39;s cubic feet per minute) could be higher for my liking. I have a similar unit from another manufacturer, similar style and dimensions, that moves much more air. Though for the price the FLO is the best deal going as well as aesthetic.",

        "comment": "My boyfriend has asthma to the point where he goes through a full inhaler about every four weeks. He is on no other meds and he just canât breathe most of the time. Itâs spring time now so the pollen is everywhere and we also just got two cats. We have had the cats about three weeks and his breathing got so bad he went through a full inhaler in about 15 days. He had this awful cough and the doctor told us we had to get rid of the cats. But I refuse. So I bought this to try to help. Without daily vacuuming and dusting, placing this in our bedroom for five days with a box fan circulating the air has helped his coughing drastically, and he is using his inhaler back to normal. Iâm pretty amazed. Iâm going to buy another one for his gaming room where he spends most of his time and I think this has changed my life. I love my cats and I love my boyfriend so I refuse to get rid of either. So this has absolutely worked for us.",

        "comment": "What an amazing attractive little air purifier. I have used air purifiers for years and this is the most attractive and easy to insert/change the filters. The only draw back is they are so powerful that on high, it creates some noise even on floors with rugs and good quality rug pad....not a huge deal though, I just turn it off or low when I go to bed.",

        "comment": "Just plugged in today. Very easy to set up. Placed in sun room which has been frequented by many cats through the years. Has been running now for about 4 hours. Been a long time since the room has not smelled. Does not smell now! Excellent product. Thinking of getting a larger model to cover the entire house. MAKE A LARGER MODEL PLZ",

        "comment": "I have pet rats and they STINK sooooo badly when I don't clean them after two days. One day I was sick and decided to just move the purifier into the same room as the rats. Every other day,even when they rats have been freshly cleaned,there's always a little stink. With the purifier in there,I smelled NOTHING.",

        "comment": "Impressed with construction quality. Fit and finish are very nice. Bought it during the fire season this year do to the immense amount of smoke we have been forced to deal with. We use it in the bedroom at night. It did make a noticeable difference. My only complaint is it is a little noisy at higher levels.",

        "comment": "BC has poor air quality due to the fires in the Summers. Fortunately for me this unit is great. I purchased this for my girlfriend because she would tell me that the smoke would burn her eyes and lungs. With this it cleared the air right up and she is very greatful that this provided her with breathable air",

        "comment": "Shipment was very prompt, and setup was fast and flawless. The unit works as advertised with no problems, the fan noise is quite low on the lower setting (which is all we need at this time). I highly recommend this air purifier, and most likely will order a second unit for the upstairs area of the house.",
